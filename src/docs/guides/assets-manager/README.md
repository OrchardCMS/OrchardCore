# Assets Manager

Based on [Concurrently](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently) the Orchard Core assets management tool is used for building, watching, hosting assets. It allows to use bundlers as [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). This is a non-opiniated tool which allows to be extended for any asset compiler/bundler that someone may require in the future. Everything is written as ES6 modules (.mjs files).

`Concurrently`, is a concurrent shell runner which allows to trigger any possible shell command.

Old assets are not compiled as ES6 modules so they don't need these bundlers. For that matter we kept the old `gulpfile.js` which will be now triggered by `Concurrently` when doing `yarn build -gr`.

Concurrently uses an `Assets.json` file that defines actions to execute. The old Gulp pipeline uses a `GulpAssets.json` file that defines actions to execute.

Parcel is the easiest way to build assets so far as it doesn't require any configuration. It is a zero file configuration bundler which means we use the same configuration for all assets. It is the recommended builder for those who want to easily start with a bundler. Though, Vite is more suited for Vue apps.

## Prerequisites

1. Install the current 22.x version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). If you are already using a different version of Node.js for other projects, we recommend using Node Version Manager (see [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for the original project for *nix systems, and [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) for Windows).
2. From the root of the repository, run the following commands. Be sure to indeed run **exactly** these, and verify that Yarn v4.6.x got installed.
    ```cmd
    REM On Windows may require to run command shell with administrator privileges.
    corepack enable 
    yarn
    ```

!!! danger
    Some third-party distributors may not include Corepack by default, in particular if you install Node.js from your system package manager. If that happens, running `npm install -g corepack` before `corepack enable` should do the trick.    

## Building assets if you change an SCSS, JS, or TS/TSX file

What to do if you change an SCSS, JS, or TS/TSX file in any of Orchard Core's projects, and want to update the output files (that go into the `wwwroot` folders)?

1. Make sure you completed the above "Prerequisites" steps.
2. Run `yarn build -gr` from the command line in the root of the repository. This will build all changed assets.

Alternatively, if you make a lot of changes during development that you want to test quickly, you don't need to run the full build every time. Instead, use `yarn watch` to automatically build assets when you save a file. For this, run `yarn watch -n asset-name`, where `asset-name` is the `name` property you can find for the given file in the `Assets.json` file of the given project's root folder. E.g., for the Audit Trail module's `audittrailui.scss` file it's `audittrail`, so the command is `yarn watch -n audittrail`. You can also watch multiple assets at once by separating their names with commas, e.g., `yarn watch -n audittrail, audit-trail-diff-viewer`.

## All features

- Build everything (including gulp rebuild): `yarn build -gr`
- Build assets manager assets only: `yarn build`
- Build with gulp: `yarn build -g`
- Build module by name: `yarn build -n asset-name`
- Build assets by tag: `yarn build -t tagname`
- Watch module by name: `yarn watch -n asset-name`.
- Host with bundler dev server: `yarn host -n asset-name`.
- Action on multiple assets with `-n` filter: `yarn {build, watch or host} -n asset-name1, asset-name2`  
- Clean folders with `yarn clean`. Will also clean parcel-cache folder.
- Makes uses of latest yarn version 4.6.0.
- Makes use of yarn workspaces which allows to import files from different locations in the app for sharing ES6 modules.
- VS Code launcher debug option added as "Asset Bundler Tool Debug"
- Gulp pipeline moved using GulpAssets.json file
- New Assets.json file definitions for building with new tool.
- Concurrently will retry building up to 3 times making CI build less prone to fail.
- All tasks can be run from within Visual Studio with the [Task Runner Explorer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.TaskRunnerExplorer).

## Random Notes

- The copy task does not watch for file changes and the watch commands do not copy files. The build command will copy files.
- Use dry-run to see a log of which files are being copied and which asset files we have in the solution.
- Parcel seems a bit picky with transpiling some libraries.

## Supported actions

### Parcel 

Runs the Parcel bundler.

**Note**: Sometimes, Parcel is too aggressive in its caching. If you manually delete any output folders, you may need to delete the `.parcel-cache` folder as well for Parcel to write to it again. Running the `yarn clean` command will clean it up for you. Also, you should set the "dest" folder of your Parcel assets to a different folder per asset defined in your Assets.json file. It is required because we are cleaning the folder before watching or building the files.

```json
[
  {
    "action": "parcel",
    "name": "module-microsoft-datasource-wrapper",
    "source": "Assets/Scripts/datasource-wrapper.js",
    "dest": "wwwroot/datasource-wrapper",
    "tags":["vue3"]
  }
]
```


The `source` property must be the entry point passed to the parcel bundler.

The `dest` property must be a folder. This is because parcel will usually output multiple files.

The `tags` property can be a string or an array of strings.

You can also pass an `options` object that override parcel options.  

### Parcel Bundling

It is possible to bundle apps together when using Parcel by using the "bundleEntrypoint" param in the Assets.json file. This allows to bundle different apps together in your app even though they are not standing in the same directory. These files will be compiled in the folder set in your build.config.mjs file standing at the root of the solution. When using bundleEntrypoint parameter there is no need to set the `dest` param.

#### Examples

Parcel bundle output folder:

```javascript
export const parcelBundleOutput = "src/OrchardCore.Modules/OrchardCore.Resources/wwwroot/Scripts/bundle"
```

Parcel bundleEntrypoint parameter:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "parcel",
    "name": "module-microsoft-datasource-wrapper",
    "source": "Assets/Scripts/datasource-wrapper.js",
    "bundleEntrypoint": "bundle-name",
    "tags":["vue3"]
  }
]
```

#### Sourcemaps

For javascript files Parcel will create a .min.js file for you along with a .map file. The .min.js is created for use in production as it doesn't reference the .map file. Using the ResourceManagementOptionsConfiguration you will want to set it this way:

```C#
    _manifest
        .DefineScript("admin")
        .SetDependencies("bootstrap", "admin-main", "theme-manager", "jQuery", "Sortable")
        .SetUrl("~/TheAdmin/js/theadmin/TheAdmin.min.js", "~/TheAdmin/js/theadmin/TheAdmin.js")
        .SetVersion("1.0.0");
```

### Vite

Vite bundler action will support any configuration. From bundling a vue app to compiling a simple library. It is working by configuration file. The asset management tool simply loads a vite.config.ts file based on the source folder that we instruct it to use from the Assets.json file.

Example of Assets.json config file:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "vite",
    "name": "my-vue-app",
    "source": "Assets/vite-project/",
    "tags": ["admin", "dashboard", "js"]
  }
]
```

The source property must be the root folder of your Vite app where your vite.config.ts or .js file stands.

#### Getting Started with Vite

Create a new module or theme in Orchard Core. This module or theme needs to have a /Assets folder.
In this /Assets folder we will create a boilerplate Vue app using this command:

```cmd
cd src/OrchardCore.Modules/path-to-your-module/Assets
yarn create vite
```

Here is an example of a Vue app using Typescript:

```cmd
➤ YN0000: · Yarn 4.6.0
➤ YN0000: · Yarn 4.6.0
➤ YN0000: ┌ Resolution step
➤ YN0085: │ + create-vite@npm:6.2.0
➤ YN0000: └ Completed
➤ YN0000: ┌ Fetch step
➤ YN0013: │ A package was added to the project (+ 141.45 KiB).
➤ YN0000: └ Completed
➤ YN0000: ┌ Link step
➤ YN0000: └ Completed
➤ YN0000: · Done in 0s 258ms

√ Project name: ... vite-project
√ Select a framework: » Vue
√ Select a variant: » TypeScript

Scaffolding project in C:\repo\OrchardCore\src\OrchardCore.Modules\OrchardCore.Media\Assets\vite-project...

Done. Now run:

  cd vite-project
  yarn
  yarn dev
```

Now you could execute the commands that are suggested. It will start the Vite dev server with HMR feature. Though what we want is to execute the server by using the asset manager tool. We will need an Assets.json file for that matter.

Create an Assets.json file at the root of your new module. For example: "src/OrchardCore.Modules/PathToYourModule/Assets.json". This file should contain these settings:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "vite",
    "name": "my-vue-app",
    "source": "Assets/vite-project/",
    "tags": ["admin", "dashboard", "js"]
  }
]
```

This `Assets.json` file will instruct the asset manager tool to execute the Vite bundler and to look at the source folder for a `vite.config.ts` or `.js` file. But we need to define where we want these assets to be compiled. For that matter we will need to modify the `vite.config.ts` file.

Here is an example of a configuration file that the asset bundler will be able to work with in the context of a Vue app. Notice that we are using `path.resolve()` so that this configuration file always returns the appropriate relative path to the asset bundler. Also, it is required that you set an `outDir` so that the assets be compiled to that directory.

For more details, these configurations are well documented on Rollup.js and Vite.js websites.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
import path from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue()],
  build: {
    outDir: path.resolve(__dirname, '../../wwwroot/Scripts/Media2/'),
  },
})
```

Execute Vite dev server from the asset manager tool:

```sh
# Move to Orchard Core src folder
cd C:/repo/OrchardCore/src

# Install dependencies
yarn 

# start vite dev server
yarn host -n my-vue-app
```

Alternatively, execute Vite watcher:

```cmd
yarn watch -n my-vue-app
```

Or simply build that Vite app:

```cmd
yarn build -n my-vue-app
```

### Webpack

Webpack bundler action will support any configuration. From bundling a vue app to compiling a simple library. It is working by configuration file. The asset management tool simply loads a given webpack.config.js file that we instruct to use from the Assets.json file.

Example of Assets.json config file:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "webpack",
    "name": "graphiql",
    "config": "/Assets/webpack.config.js",
    "tags": ["admin", "dashboard", "js"]
  }
]
```

The config property must be the path to where your webpack.config.js file stands.

### Run

Allows to run any command through Concurrently.

```json
[
  {
    "action": "run",
    "name": "itwin-viewer-app",
    "source": "Assets/itwin-viewer-app",
    "scripts": {
      "build": "yarn run build",
      "watch": "yarn run start"
    }
  }
]
```

Here, the `source` property must be a folder and is used as the working directory where the command is ran.

The scripts keys must match the command used to start the pipeline. If you start the pipeline with `yarn build` this would run all `build` scripts of the run actions.

### Copy

Allows to copy files.

```json
[
  {
    "action": "copy",
    "dryRun": true,
    "name": "copy-bootstrap-js",
    "source": "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/*.js*",
    "dest": "wwwroot/Scripts"
  },
  {
    "action": "copy",
    "name": "copy-bootstrap-css",
    "source": "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/*.css*",
    "dest": "wwwroot/Styles"
  }
]
```

The source field can be a file, or a glob of files.
The destination should always be a folder as we do not support renaming files.
You can use the dry-run task to log to the console where the files will be copied to.

### Min  

Allows to minify files.

```json
[
  {
    "action": "min",
    "dryRun": true,
    "name": "copy-bootstrap-js",
    "source": "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/*.js*",
    "dest": "wwwroot/Scripts"
  },
  {
    "action": "min",
    "name": "copy-bootstrap-css",
    "source": "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/*.css*",
    "dest": "wwwroot/Styles"
  }
]
```

The source field can be a file, or a glob.

The destination should always be a folder as we do not support renaming files.

You can use the dry-run task to log to the console where the files will be copied to.

### Sass

Allows to transpile scss files.

```json
[
  {
    "action": "sass",
    "name": "transpile-bootstrap-scss",
    "source": "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/main.scss",
    "dest": "wwwroot/Styles"
  }
]
```

The source field can be a file, or a glob.

The destination should always be a folder as we do not support renaming files.

You can use the dry-run task to log to the console where the files will be copied to.


## build.config.mjs

You can create a `build.config.mjs` file next to the root `package.json`.

This file allows you to customize options used by the build tools.

For example, if you wanted to override the parcel browserlist:

```javascript
// The type of command running and the current group's json object.
export function parcel(type, group) {
  return {
    defaultTargetOptions: {
      engines: {
        browsers: "> 1%, last 4 versions, not dead",
      },
    },
  };
}
```

Here is an example for Vite:

```javascript
import vue from "@vitejs/plugin-vue";

export function viteConfig(action) {
  return {
    plugins: [vue()],
    build: {
      minify: false,
      rollupOptions: {
        output: {
          manualChunks: (id) => {
            if (id.includes("node_modules")) {
              if (id.includes("@vue") || id.includes("/vue/")) {
                return "vue";
              }
              return "vendor"; // all other package goes here
            }
          },
        },
      },
    },
  };
}
```

You can also specify the glob pattern used to harvest the `Assets.json` files in your solution in the build.config.mjs file

```javascript
export const assetsLookupGlob = "src/{OrchardCore.Modules,OrchardCore.Themes}/*/Assets.json";
```

## ECMAScript vs CommonJS (Bundlers)

The ECMAScript module (ESM) format is the standardized way of loading JavaScript packages. CommonJS is a legacy implementation of modules that is not standardized. ESM is asynchronously loaded, while CommonJS is synchronous. We should favorize building as ESM modules. 

Vite ([rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/)) will build by default as ECMAScripts and it is by design. Parcel will automatically build as CommonJS or ECMAScript based on package.json configuration; CommonJS being the default when the "type" parameter is not specified. 

To be able to compile as ECMAScript there are requirements.  

1 - the package.json file needs to have:  

```json
{
  "type": "module",
}
```

This should be enough for any single script files that we want to execute asynchronously. 

Though, for Vue 3 apps to use ECMAScript; it needs to use an alias to its ESM bundler version to prevent needing it everywhere in the different components of the app.  

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'vue' //needs an alias to 'vue/dist/vue.esm-bundler.js'
```

Example for an app that will use Vite/TS would be to add this configuration to a vite.config.ts file.

```json
resolve: {
    alias: {
        'vue': 'vue/dist/vue.esm-bundler.js',
    },
},
```

Also, now when adding a `<script>` tag to the HTML, you will need to use:

```html
<script type="module" src="somepath"></script>
```

`<script>` tags are non-ESM by default; you have to add a `type="module"` attribute to opt into ESM mode.

Meaning that the ESM script will be interpreted as CommonJS by the browser if the script tag doesn't have it.

+Additionally, Vite by default only allows ES6 builds. It will log a message to the console if you attempt to use its .js builds without the `type="module"` attribute in the script tag; otherwise, it will throw exceptions in the code. Therefore, it is mandatory to include `type="module"` with Vite builds.
+
+Parcel allows ES6 builds by setting the `"type": "module"` parameter in the package.json file. If this parameter is not set, Parcel will compile as CommonJS.
+
+ESM compiled scripts will load fine in a script tag without the `type="module"` attribute. However, you should try to avoid this.
