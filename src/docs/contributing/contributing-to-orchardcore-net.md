# Contributing orchardcore.net

Did you know that Orchard Core's official website, [orchardcore.net](https://orchardcore.net), is also an open-source project? And, of course, it's built using Orchard Core itself!

## How to start

To start, just clone the [Orchard Core Website repository](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Website). Instructions on working with the app are available in its Readme. Happy coding!


!!! tip
    Contributing to orchardcore.net is a great way to get familiar with Orchard Core development on a real-life application, which is online and accessible to everyone already. If you're new to Orchard Core, consider starting here before diving into the main Orchard Core repository.

## What can you contribute?

First, check out the [issues](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Website/issues), but you can suggest content and technical improvements as well in the issue tracker.

## Need help?

Feel free to ask questions under the repository's issues, or in the `#🌐┃orchardcore-net` channel on [our Discord server](https://orchardcore.net/discord).
