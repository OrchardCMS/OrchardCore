# Amazon S3 Media (`OrchardCore.Media.AmazonS3`)

The Amazon S3 Media module enables support for storing assets in Amazon S3 Buckets.

## Amazon S3 Media Storage (`OrchardCore.Media.AmazonS3`)

The feature replaces the default App_Data file-based media store with an Amazon Media Storage Provider.

Media is still served by the Orchard Core website, and the Media Cache module takes responsibility for fetching media, on the fly, from the Amazon S3 Bucket.

This allows the Amazon Media Storage feature to support image resizing on the fly through integration with `ImageSharp.Web`.

The URL generated by the AssetUrl helpers points to the Orchard Core website.

### Configuration

The following configuration values are used by default and can be customized:

```json
{
   "OrchardCore": {
       "OrchardCore_Media_AmazonS3": {
           // If you have AWS CLI installed and configured you may just specify a profile name.
           "Profile": "",
           // In case your AWS profiles are located not in the default place.
           "ProfilesLocation": "",
           "Region": "",
           // This section needed only if Orchard will be hosted not in the AWS Cloud
           // You can obtain all that information in the IAM Management Console
            "Credentials": {
              "SecretKey": "",
              "AccessKey": ""
           },
           // Optionally, set to a path to store media in a subdirectory inside your container.
           "BasePath": "/media",
           "CreateBucket": false,
           // Your AWS S3 Bucket name.
           "BucketName": ""
       }
  }
}
```

Refer also to the [Configuration Section](../../core/Configuration/README.md),
and the [Media Section](../Media/README.md) for other Media related configuration settings.

There are two hosting options: inside and outside AWS Cloud.
In case you are hosting Orchard Core inside AWS (EC2, EKS, etc.) you need to configure only `BucketName` and you may delete or comment out the other sections.

In case you are hosting Orchard Core outside of AWS, you should fill the `Credentials` section or if you have AWS CLI installed and configured on your server you may specify only configured profile name (`default` if a profile name was not chosen during AWS CLI configuration).

You can find region endpoints in the [Official AWS S3 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html), see Region column. For example for the Frankfurt region you should use `eu-central-1`

### AWS Credentials and its loading order

`OrchardCore_Media_AmazonS3` is a subset of `AWSOptions` configuration and should be configured the same as a generic [AWSOptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/net-dg-config-netcore.html).

#### Credentials loading order

1. Credentials property of `AWSOptions˙.
2. Shared Credentials File (Custom Location). When both the profile and profile location are specified.
3. SDK Store (Windows Only). When an instance of `AWSOptions˙ is provided and only the profile is set (profile location is null or empty).
4. Shared Credentials File (Default Location). When an instance of `AWSOptions˙ is provided and only the profile is set (profile location is null or empty).
5. AWS Web Identity Federation Credentials. When an OIDC token file exists and is set in the environment variables.
6. `CredentialsProfileStoreChain`
   1. SDK Store (Windows Only) encrypted using Windows Data Protection API.
   2. Shared Credentials File in the default location.
7. Environment variables. When the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key environment variables are set.
8. ECS Task Credentials or EC2 Instance Credentials. When using IAM roles with ECS tasks and ECS instances.

!!! note
    The AWS team wants to encourage using profiles instead of embedding credentials directly into `appsettings.X.json` files where they would accidentally get checked into source control.
    If you have an option to use profiles or environment variables - you should use it instead of direct credentials.

### AWS S3 Bucket Configuration

If `CreateBucket` was configured as `true` and `BucketName` follows official [Bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html), then a new bucket will be created.
The new bucket will be created without [Access Control Lists](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html) due to security reasons. If you create the bucket manually then you need to do it with ACLs enabled. When using a previously created bucket, you may need to configure ACLs manually:

1. Open your bucket.
2. Go to the Permissions tab.
3. Edit "Block public access".
4. Tick "Block all public access".

#### S3 Bucket policies

By default, AWS 3S Bucket has limitations for newly uploaded files. If you want media files to be available from the outside of AWS, you should set up your bucket permissions.

The simplest way of doing it is to add a policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AddPerm",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/YOR-BASE-PATH/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

After this policy will be added to your bucket permissions all newly added files will have Read permission and will be available from the outside of the Amazon Cloud.

### Templating Configuration

Optionally you may use Liquid templating to further configure Amazon Media Storage, perhaps creating a bucket per tenant,
or a single bucket with a base path per tenant.

The `ShellSettings` property is made available to the Liquid template.
The `BucketName` property and the `BasePath` property are the only templatable properties.

!!! note
    When templating the `BucketName`  using  `{{ ShellSettings.Name }}`, the tenant's name will be automatically lowercased, however, you must also make sure the `BucketName` conforms to other Amazon S3 naming conventions as set out in Amazon's documentation.

#### Configuring a bucket per tenant

```json
{
    "OrchardCore": {
        "OrchardCore_Media_AmazonS3": {
            "BucketName": "{{ ShellSettings.Name }}-media",
            "Region": "",
            "Credentials": {
                "SecretKey": "",
                "AccessKey": ""
            },
            "BasePath": "/media",
            "Profile": "",
            "ProfilesLocation": ""
        }
    }
}
```

#### Configuring a single bucket, with a base folder per tenant

```json
{
    "OrchardCore": {
        "OrchardCore_Media_AmazonS3": {
            "BucketName": "",
            "Region": "",
            "Credentials": {
                "SecretKey": "",
                "AccessKey": ""
            },
            "BasePath": "{{ ShellSettings.Name }}/Media",
            "Profile": "",
            "ProfilesLocation" : ""
        }
    }
}
```

## Configuring a Local Emulator

During development, instead of using an online S3 resource, you can use a local storage emulator too. This is especially important for development teams since you don't want to step on each others' feet by using a shared storage.

For emulators, you'll need to configure a `ServiceURL`. Instead of the default [virtual host addressing of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html), you'll also need to enable path-style addressing (i.e. instead of `http://mybucket.localhost`, the local bucket will be accessible under `http://localhost/mybucket`).

```json
{
    "OrchardCore": {
        "OrchardCore_Media_AmazonS3": {
            // Note how we use ServiceURL, just with emulators. There should be no Region specified.
            "ServiceURL": "http://localhost:9444/",
            "Profile": "default",
            "ProfilesLocation": "",
            // Providing some credentials is required but emulators don't actually use them.
            "Credentials": {
                "SecretKey": "dummy",
                "AccessKey": "dummy"
            },
            // BasePath and BucketName can be templated too, as usual.
            "BasePath": "/media",
            "CreateBucket": true,
            "RemoveBucket": true,
            "BucketName": "media",
            // This is required for all emulators.
            "ForcePathStyle": true
        }
    }
}
```

The following tools are known to be working with the above settings. Be sure to explore further configuration of these tools, the commands below are just provided for your convenience as a general recommendation.

- [LocalS3](https://github.com/Robothy/local-s3) with Docker:

```
docker run -d -e MODE=IN_MEMORY -p 9444:80 luofuxiang/local-s3
```

- [S3Mock](https://github.com/adobe/S3Mock) with Docker:

```
docker run -p 9444:9090 -t adobe/s3mock
```

### Media Cache

The Media Cache feature will automatically be enabled when Amazon Media Storage is enabled.

The Media Cache feature will cache files stored in Amazon S3 Storage, to support image resizing.

The Media Cache feature allows Purging of the Media Cache files stored locally.

You might choose to use the Purging feature if you are fronting the media assets with a CDN.
After allowing a long enough period of time for the CDN to have fetched a significant number of Media assets, both resized, and full size, from the Media Cache you might consider purging the cache.

However please bear in mind that your CDN provider will likely have multiple Points of Presence worldwide, and each of these will maintain their own cache, so while a local CDN PoP might have the asset another PoP may not, until it is requested. At this stage the Media Cache will, if necessary, refetch the asset from Amazon S3 Storage, on the fly, and provide it to the CDN PoP.

CDN providers also clear their caches at pre-determined times of their own devising, so while CDNs are a valuable caching and performance asset, it is important that they are always be able to re-fetch the source file, as and when required, which the Media Cache Module will automatically handle.

!!! note
    The Media Feature is designed to support one storage provider at a time, whether that is
    local File Storage (the default), Azure Blob Storage, or Amazon S3 Storage.

## Amazon Media ImageSharp Image Cache (`OrchardCore.Media.AmazonS3.ImageSharpImageCache`)

The feature replaces the default `PhysicalFileSystemCache` of ImageSharp that stores resized images in the `App_Data` folder with [`AWSS3StorageCache`](https://docs.sixlabors.com/articles/imagesharp.web/imagecaches.html#awss3storagecache) that stores them in Amazon S3 storage. Depending on your use case, this can provide the following advantages:

- Persistent image cache not to have to repeatedly resize images, even if the local file system of the webserver is ephemeral. This helps if you e.g. use containers to host the app, or do clean deployments to the webserver that remove all previously existing files.
- Better performance if disk IO is a bottleneck: The local storage of the webserver may be slow or access to it deliberately throttled. Using S3 can alleviate pressure on the local disk, leaving more resources available to serve other requests, as well as offer a higher request per second limit for image requests.

!!! note
    Cache files are only removed for a tenant when removing the tenant itself if you use a separate bucket for each tenant.

### Configuration

The following configuration values are used by default and can be customized:

```json
{
  "OrchardCore": {
    "OrchardCore_Media_AmazonS3_ImageSharp_Cache": {
      "Region": "eu-central-1",
      "Profile": "default",
      "ProfilesLocation": "",
      "Credentials": {
        "SecretKey": "",
        "AccessKey": ""
      },
      "BasePath": "/media", // Optionally, set to a path to store media in a subdirectory inside your bucket.
      "CreateBucket": true,
      "RemoveBucket": true, // Whether the 'Bucket' is deleted if the tenant is removed, false by default.
      "BucketName": "imagesharp" // Set the bucket's name (mandatory).
    },
  }
}
```

!!! note
    Templating the configuration and configuring a bucket per tenant, as well as using a local emulator work the same way as for Amazon S3 Media Storage; follow its documentation above.
