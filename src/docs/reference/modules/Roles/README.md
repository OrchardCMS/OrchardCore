# Roles (`OrchardCore.Roles`)

Enabling the `OrchardCore.Roles` module will allow you to manage the user roles.

## Predefined Roles

Orchard Core defines the following predefined permission stereotypes:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Administrator` | A **system role** that grants all permissions to the assigned users. |
| `Anonymous` | A **system role** representing all non-authenticated users. |
| `Authenticated` | A **system role** representing all authenticated users. |
| `Author` | Grants users the ability to create content. |
| `Contributor` | Grants users the ability to contribute content. |
| `Editor` | Grants users the ability to edit existing content. |
| `Moderator` | Grants users the ability to moderate content. |

!!! note
    System roles cannot be deleted, and the `Administrator` role cannot be edited.

## Roles Configuration

Roles can be created and configured through the roles menu in the admin dashboard, but also through a recipe step. Note that roles for features are not predefined. They are created out of predefined permission stereotypes.

A sample of a roles configuration step:

```json
{
    "steps": [
        {
            "name": "roles",
            "Roles": [
                {
                    "Name": "Journalist",
                    "Description" "Journalist Role",
                    "PermissionBehavior": "Replace",
                    "Permissions": ["PublishContent", "EditContent"]
                },
                {
                    "Name": "Subscriber",
                    "Description" "Subscriber Role",
                    "PermissionBehavior": "Replace",
                    "Permissions": []
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

As of version 3.0, the `Roles` recipe includes the ability to define specific permission behaviors, giving you greater control over how permissions are managed within a role. The following behaviors are available:

- **Replace**: This behavior removes all existing permissions associated with the role and replaces them with the new permissions from the `Permissions` collection. This is the default behavior.
- **Add**: This behavior adds the new permission(s) from the `Permissions` collection to the role, but only if they do not already exist. Existing permissions are left unchanged.
- **Remove**: This behavior removes the specified permission(s) from the roleâ€™s existing permissions based on the `Permissions` collection.

### Example: Adding a New Permission to a Role

For instance, to add the "CanChat" permission to the `Subscriber` role, use the following configuration:

```json
{
    "steps": [
        {
            "name": "roles",
            "Roles": [
                {
                    "Name": "Subscriber",
                    "PermissionBehavior": "Add",
                    "Permissions": ["CanChat"]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
