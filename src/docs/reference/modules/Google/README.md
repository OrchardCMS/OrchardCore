+ An existing user can link his account to his Google account through the External Logins link from User menu.

## Google Settings Configuration

The `OrchardCore.Google` module allows the user to use configuration values to override the settings configured from the admin area by calling the `ConfigureGoogleSettings()` extension method on `OrchardCoreBuilder` when initializing the app.

The following configuration values can be customized:

```json
    "OrchardCore_Google": {
      "ClientID": "",
      "ClientSecret": "",
      "CallbackPath": "/signin-google",
      "SaveTokens": false
    }
```
