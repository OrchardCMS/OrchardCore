# Spatial (OrchardCore.Spatial)

This modules provides a **GeoPointField** which can be used to give a geographic position to content.

## Lucene Geo Queries

See <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/geo-queries.html> for details.

## Terms Specifications

`geo_bounding_box`: Finds documents within a top, left, bottom, right coordinates given. Does not evaluate a distance between a central point and it's borders.

`geo_distance`: Finds documents from a given central point and a distance in a specified unit (km, miles ...). Does evaluate a precise distance between each documents and this given central point. It uses a Haversine mathematical formula to evaluate the distance of each documents and it's central point. Which means you should try to use a `geo_bounding_box` to limit it's evaluated documents on large datasets for perf.

`distance`: The distance is not linear since the earth is round this is why it is called "as the crow flies".

## Geo Bounding Box

A filtered query returning documents based on a point location using a bounding box. The `geo_bounding_box` is commonly used to retrieve records quick without taking care of precision.

Assuming a BlogPost content item has a `GeoPointField` named Location with the value `[Lat:-33, Long:138]`.  
Here is an example lucene query for finding all BlogPost content items with a Location field added within an area.

```json
// Example lucene query parameters
// { "top": -33, "left": 137, "bottom" :-35, "right" : 139 }

{
    "query": {
        "bool" : {
            "must" : {
                "match_all" : {}
            },
            "filter" : {
                "geo_bounding_box" : {
                    "BlogPost.Location" : {
                        "top_left" : {
                            "lat" : {{top}},
                            "lon" : {{left}}
                        },
                        "bottom_right" : {
                            "lat" : {{bottom}},
                            "lon" : {{right}}
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This will return a result assuming that you have a content item with a **Geopoint Field with Lat -34, Long 138** for example.

## Geo Distance

A filtered query returning documents that exist within a specific distance from a geo point.

Assuming a BlogPost content item has a `GeoPointField` named Location with the value `[Lat:-33, Long:138]`

```json
{
    "query": {
        "bool" : {
            "must" : {
                "match_all" : {}
            },
            "filter" : {
                "geo_distance" : {
                    "distance" : "200km",
                    "BlogPost.Location" : {
                        "lat" : -34,
                        "lon" : 138
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note: a 200km radius equates to approximately 1.7986 degrees of arc from the geo point centre. So searching at `[-34.8, 138]` should be greater than 200km from the content location and not return it as a result.

Here is another Query that combines a `geo_bounding_box` with a `geo_distance` filtered query. They should be used together to fasten the Query results because you generally want to evaluate a distance on fewer records than what the database holds for perf reasons:

              "lon": {{right}}
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
