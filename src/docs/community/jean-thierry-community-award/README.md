# Jean-Thierry Kéchichian Community Award

After the passing of our beloved [Jean-Thierry](../jean-thierry/README.md) to honor him, keep his memory alive, and foremost, inspire people to do good work for the community, we launched an award named after him for exceptional community members.

Every year, the community votes on who has done the most for Orchard Core. This can entail activities in the form of e.g. code contributions (including documentation), help under issues and discussion, evangelization outreach, community management, or anything else. However, it needs to be public and tangible.

After a public round of nominations, the community votes on the nominees secretly. The winner is then announced at the annual Orchard Harvest conference.

## Perks of winning the Jean-Thierry Kéchichian Community Award

The award is foremost about recognition. However, the community provides some perks too:

- Mention of each year's winner in the docs above.
- Post about it under the Orchard Core social media.
- [Lombiq](https://lombiq.com/) provides free custom domain usage on [DotNest](https://dotnest.com/), publicizing the winner in Lombiq's media, and a year of sponsorship similar to [other open source contributors and projects](https://lombiq.com/open-source).

If your company works with Orchard Core and would like to incentivize community members, please let us know what else you can add!
