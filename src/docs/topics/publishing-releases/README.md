# Publishing a new Orchard Core release

These notes are primarily for Orchard's core contributors to guide how to prepare a new release.

## Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). Note that this allows only bug fixes in patch versions (e.g. `1.2.x`), new features in minor versions (e.g. `1.x.0`), and breaking changes only in major versions (`x.0.0`).

## Release checklist

[Create a release issue](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/issues/new/choose) and follow its checklist, ticking everything as you progress.
