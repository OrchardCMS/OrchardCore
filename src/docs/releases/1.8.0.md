# Orchard Core 1.8.0

Release date: January 2, 2024

In this update, we've introduced several significant changes that may require your attention before upgrading. Additionally, performance-related enhancements have been implemented to optimize your app's scalability, especially when dealing with a large number of tenants.

## Breaking Changes

The interface `OrchardCore.Documents.IDocumentSerialiser` has been renamed to `OrchardCore.Documents.IDocumentSerializer`.

### .NET support

This release removes support for `net6.0` and `net7.0`. Only `net8.0` is supported.

### TheAdmin Theme

The `TheAdmin` theme was upgraded to Bootstrap 5.3.2. Here is a list of the breaking changes

- The `bg-primary` class was changed to `text-bg-theme`.
- The `darkmode` theme is now called `dark`.
- The `default` theme is now called `light`.
- By default, the theme is set to `auto` which allows us to use the default device color preference.
- Material-icons are no longer included.
- The `DarkModeService.cs` was replaced with `ThemeTogglerService`.
- The property named `DisplayDarkMode` in `AdminSettings` was replaced with `DisplayThemeToggler`.
- Bootstrap is no longer compiled in `TheAdmin.css`. Bootstrap are loaded independently for performance and maintainability reasons.

### Workflow Module

A new option for restarting a specific Workflow instance has been incorporated, involving adjustments to both the `IActivity` and `IWorkflowManager` interfaces.The following method was added to `IWorkflowManager` interface.

- `Task<WorkflowExecutionContext> RestartWorkflowAsync(WorkflowType workflowType, IDictionary<string, object> input = null, string correlationId = null)`

 The following methods were added to the `IActivity` interface.

- `Task OnWorkflowRestartingAsync(WorkflowExecutionContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)`
- `Task OnWorkflowRestartedAsync(WorkflowExecutionContext context)`

### Navbar

 The `NavbarTop` zone is no longer used in the `TheAdmin` or `TheTheme` themes. Follow the Navbar details below on how to inject custom menu items in the navbar.

### Diagnostics Module

The HTTP error views are now in the form of shapes. If you've made customizations to error views within your theme, you should search for `BadRequest`, `Forbidden`, `NotFound`, and `Unauthorized` views in either `YourTheme/Views/OrchardCore.Diagnostics/Diagnostics` or `YourTheme/Views/Shared` and relocate them to `YourTheme/Views`. Afterwards, append `HttpError-` to their names. For instance, `NotFound.cshtml` should be renamed to `HttpError-NotFound.cshtml`.

Additionally, if you've customized the `Error.cshtml` view, it should be renamed to `HttpError.cshtml` since it acts as the default template for error pages.

### Infrastructure Changes

The following interfaces have been updated to incorporate new asynchronous methods, corresponding to each synchronous method. All synchronous methods have been deprecated and should no longer be utilized.

- `IStereotypeService`
- `IStereotypesProvider`
- `IRouteableContentTypeProvider`
- `IRouteableContentTypeCoordinator`
- `IContentDefinitionService`
- `IContentDefinitionManager`
- `IContentDefinitionService`

## Change Logs

### TheTheme Theme

The `TheTheme` theme was upgraded to Bootstrap 5.3.2. New `light` and `dark` modes were added.

### Navbar

The upper navigation bar has been transformed into a customizable shape, allowing for easy integration of items. The `NavbarTop` zone is no longer used in the `TheAdmin` or `TheTheme` themes. If you wish to add a menu item to the navigation bar, simply create a display driver for `Navbar`.

As an illustration, we inject the theme toggler into both `Detail` and `DetailAdmin` display type using a display driver as outlined below:

```csharp
public class ToggleThemeNavbarDisplayDriver : DisplayDriver<Navbar>
{
    public override Task<IDisplayResult> DisplayAsync(Navbar model, BuildDisplayContext context)
    {
        return Task.FromResult<IDisplayResult>(
            View("ToggleTheme", model)
            .Location("Detail", "Content:10")
            .Location("DetailAdmin", "Content:10")
        );
    }
}
```

 Additionally, the follow shapes have been removed

- `ContentCulturePickerContainer`
- `AdminCulturePickerContainer`

#### `Navbar` Shape for Custom Theme

To add the `Navbar` shape into your own front-end theme, add the following code into your layout.

```
@inject IDisplayManager<Navbar> DisplayManager
@inject IUpdateModelAccessor UpdateModelAccessor

@await DisplayAsync(await DisplayManager.BuildDisplayAsync<Navbar>(UpdateModelAccessor.ModelUpdater))
```

To add the `Navbar` shape into your own back-end theme, add the following code into your layout.

```
@inject IDisplayManager<Navbar> DisplayManager
@inject IUpdateModelAccessor UpdateModelAccessor

@await DisplayAsync(await DisplayManager.BuildDisplayAsync<Navbar>(UpdateModelAccessor.ModelUpdater, "DetailAdmin"))
```

### Elasticsearch Module

Introduced a new option in `ElasticSettings` that permits the definition of a custom query for the default search. For instance, the following is an example of a search query supporting the [fuzziness](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/common-options.html#fuzziness) option:

```
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "Content.ContentItem.FullText": {
        "query": "{{ term }}",
        "fuzziness": "AUTO",
        "analyzer": "whitespace"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
