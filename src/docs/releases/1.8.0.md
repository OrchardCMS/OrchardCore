## Breaking Changes

### TheAdmin Theme

The `TheAdmin` theme was upgraded to Bootstrap 5.3.2. Here is a list of the breaking changes

 - The `bg-primary` class was changed to `text-bg-theme`.
 - The `darkmode` theme is now called `dark`.
 - The `default` theme is now called `light`.
 - By default, the theme is set to `auto` which allows us to use the default device color preference.
 - Metrial-icons are no longer included.
 - The `DarkModeService.cs` was replaced with `ThemeTogglerService`.
 - The property named `DisplayDarkMode` in `AdminSettings` was replaced with `DisplayThemeToggler`.
 - Bootstrap is no longer compiled in `TheAdmin.css`. Bootstrap assets are loaded independently for performance and maintainability reasons.
