## Change Logs

### `OrchardCore.AdminDashboard` Module

A sample widget is no longer auto created when the `OrchardCore.AdminDashboard` feature is enabled. If you like to see a sample widget, you may do so by executing the "Admin Dashboard Widget Sample" recipe by using the admin menu and navigate to **Configuration** >> **Recipes**

### `OrchardCore.Users` Module

Added support for complete two-factor authentication out of the box. [Click here](../reference/modules/Users/README.md) for more info.

### `OrchardCore.Contents` Module

The Contents admin UI now provides a way to manage content items of content types that share the same Stereotype.

For example, lets say we want list all content items of a content types that use `Test` stereotype. To do that, add an admin menu item that directs the user to `/Admin/Contents/ContentItems?stereotype=Test`. Adding `stereotype=Test` to the URL will render the UI using any content type that has `Test` as it's stereotype.
