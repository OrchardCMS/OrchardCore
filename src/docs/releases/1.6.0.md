# Orchard Core 1.6.0

Release date: Not yet released

## Breaking Changes

### Users

The `OrchardCore.Users` module now provides multiple new permissions for added control on user related functions. 

In previous versions, `View Users` permission was enough to show the `Users` menu item. However, with the newly added permissions, `ListUsers` or at least one `ListUsersInRole_{0}` variation is required to see the `Users` menu. The `View Users` permission now only allows you to view user's profile. The permission `ManageUsers` is a super user permission which grants all access to manage user including user settings.

Here is a list of the new permissions

| Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ListUsers` | allows listing all users. |
| `EditUsers` | allow editing any user. |
| `DeleteUsers` | allows deleting any user. |

 The following permissions will be available if `OrchardCore.Roles` feature in enabled.

 | Permission | Description |
 | --- | --- |
 | `AssignRoleToUsers` | allows assigning any role to users. |
 | `ListUsersInRole_{0}` | allows listing users in a given role. |
 | `EditUsersInRole_{0}` | allows editing users in a given role. |
 | `DeleteUsersInRole_{0}` | allows deleting users in a given role. |
 | `AssignRoleToUsers_{0}` | allows assigning users to a given role. |

### Features and Recipes

`OrchardCore.Features` is no longer auto enabled by `OrchardCore.Recipes` as it doesn't depend on it anymore. If you find yourself using recipes services like `IRecipeMigrator` in your module, be sure to add a dependency on `OrchardCore.Recipes.Core` feature in your module's Manifest file to ensures that the recipe services are available before using them.

If your are using setup recipes and want to enable `Features`, be sure to explicitly enable `OrchardCore.Feature` feature.

## Change Logs

Prior this release, a user with `ViewContent` permission and has access to the dashboard, automatically gets access to "Content Items". Now, to be able to list contents on the dashboard, a user needs `ListContent` permission instead. 

### Setting for `TheAdmin` theme

New settings were added to the `TheAdmin` theme, to allow you to make the admin theme responsive based on the screen size.

For example, adding the following settings in the `appsettings.json` file will produce the screencasts below

```json
{
"OrchardCore": {
  "TheAdminTheme": {
    "StyleSettings": {
      "LimitedWidth": "col-md-6 col-lg-5 col-xxl-4",
      "StartClasses": "col-lg-2 col-xl-3",
      "EndClasses": "col-lg-10 col-xl-9",
      "LabelClasses": "col-form-label text-lg-end col-lg-2 col-xl-3",
      "OffsetClasses": "offset-lg-2 offset-xl-3"
    }
  }
}
```

For custom part or field editor to work with the new settings, you must update your view to use the new helpers.
 1. Wrap the parent element with `row` class. Optionally, for consistent look you may want to also use `mb-3` class as well.
 2. Call `Orchard.GetLabelCssClasses()` helper to get the proper css classes for label elements.
 3. Wrap all elements that correspond to the label with an element like `div` to group them. Then use `Orchard.GetEndCssClasses()` helper to get the proper css classes for the new `div`.

For example, the `TitlePart.Edit.cshtml` view was changed from 

```
<div class="mb-3" asp-validation-class-for="Title">
    <label asp-for="Title">@T["Title"]</label>
    <input asp-for="Title" class="form-control content-preview-text content-caption-text" disabled="@(Model.Settings?.Options == TitlePartOptions.GeneratedDisabled)" autofocus="autofocus" dir="@culture.GetLanguageDirection()" />
    <span asp-validation-for="Title"></span>
    @if (!String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(Model.Settings?.Pattern))
    {
        switch (Model.Settings?.Options)
        {
            case TitlePartOptions.Editable:
                <span class="hint">@T["Leave empty to auto-generate the title using the pattern."]</span>
                break;
            case TitlePartOptions.GeneratedDisabled:
                <span class="hint">@T["The title will be auto-generated using the pattern."]</span>
                break;
        }
    }
</div>
```

to the following 

```
<!-- The parent element is now using row in addition to mb-3 class. -->
<div class="row mb-3" asp-validation-class-for="Title">
    <!-- The GetLabelCssClasses() helper is used in the label element. -->
    <label asp-for="Title" class="@Orchard.GetLabelCssClasses()">@T["Title"]</label>

    <!-- This div was added to group the corresponding element. Additionally, GetEndCssClasses() is used to get the proper classes. -->
    <div class="@Orchard.GetEndCssClasses()">
        <input asp-for="Title" class="form-control content-preview-text content-caption-text" disabled="@(Model.Settings?.Options == TitlePartOptions.GeneratedDisabled)" autofocus="autofocus" dir="@culture.GetLanguageDirection()" />
        <span asp-validation-for="Title"></span>
        @if (!String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(Model.Settings?.Pattern))
        {
            switch (Model.Settings?.Options)
            {
                case TitlePartOptions.Editable:
                    <span class="hint">@T["Leave empty to auto-generate the title using the pattern."]</span>
                    break;
                case TitlePartOptions.GeneratedDisabled:
                    <span class="hint">@T["The title will be auto-generated using the pattern."]</span>
                    break;
            }
        }
    </div>
</div>
```

Here is a list of all added helpers

| Helper | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Orchard.GetLimitedWidthCssClasses()` | used for a field that have limited width like `number` element. For an example, look at `NumericField.Edit.cshtml` view. |
| `Orchard.GetLabelCssClasses()` | gets the css classes for a label element. |
| `Orchard.GetStartCssClasses()` | gets the css classes for a starting section. For example, if you want to push your elements to the end to line it up with a label. |
| `Orchard.GetEndCssClasses()` | gets the css classes for the ending section. |
| `Orchard.GetEndCssClasses(bool withOffset)` | gets the css classes for the ending section with optionally an offset. |
| `Orchard.GetOffsetCssClasses()` | gets the offset classes to align the end elements.  |
