# Orchard Core 1.6.0

Release date: March 2023

This release contains many bug fixes, performance upgrade, and enhancements. It is recommended to update your existing Orchard Core deployments with this version.

## Breaking Changes

### Users

The `OrchardCore.Users` module now provides multiple new permissions for added control on user related functions.

In previous versions, the `View Users` permission was enough to show the `Users` menu item. However, with the newly added permissions, `ListUsers` or at least one `ListUsersInRole_{0}` variation is required to see the `Users` menu. The `View Users` permission now only allows you to view a user's profile. The permission `ManageUsers` is a super user permission which grants all access to manage users including user settings.

Here is a list of the new permissions:

| Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ListUsers` | allows listing all users. |
| `EditUsers` | allow editing any user. |
| `DeleteUsers` | allows deleting any user. |

The following permissions will be available if the `OrchardCore.Roles` feature is enabled:

| Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AssignRoleToUsers` | allows assigning any role to users. |
| `ListUsersInRole_{0}` | allows listing users in a given role. |
| `EditUsersInRole_{0}` | allows editing users in a given role. |
| `DeleteUsersInRole_{0}` | allows deleting users in a given role. |
| `AssignRoleToUsers_{0}` | allows assigning users to a given role. |

### `OrchardCore.Roles` Module

As of version 1.6, the default roles are no longer auto created. The setup recipe *must* define the default roles to be used. The Roles feature will automatically map all known permissions to the defined roles each time a feature is enabled. For more info on creating roles using a recipe, visit the [Roles Step documentation](../reference/modules/Recipes/README.md#roles-step).

### `OrchardCore.Search` Module

The property `SearchProviderAreaName` in the `SearchSettings` class was renamed to `ProviderName`. If you are using both `Lucene` and `Elasticsearch` search providers at the same time, you'll need to update the search settings by setting the default search provider to one of the two.

Additionally, the namespace of the `SearchFormViewModel`, `SearchIndexViewModel`, and `SearchResultViewModel` was changed from `OrchardCore.Search.Abstractions.ViewModels` to `OrchardCore.Search.ViewModels`.

The namespace of the `SearchSettings` class changed from `OrchardCore.Search.Model` to `OrchardCore.Search.Models`.

### Features and Recipes

`OrchardCore.Features` is no longer auto enabled by `OrchardCore.Recipes` as it doesn't depend on it anymore. If you find yourself using recipe services like `IRecipeMigrator` in your module, be sure to add a dependency on the `OrchardCore.Recipes.Core` feature in your module's `Manifest` file to ensures that the recipe services are available before using them.

If your are using setup recipes and want to enable `Features`, be sure to explicitly enable the `OrchardCore.Features` feature.

## Change Logs

### New `OrchardCore.Notifications` Module

New feature was added to provide a way to send notification messages to the users. [Click here](../reference/modules/Notifications/README.md) for more info about notifications.

### `OrchardCore.Contents` Module

Prior this release, a user with `ViewContent` permission and has access to the dashboard, automatically gets access to "Content Items". Now, to be able to list contents on the dashboard, a user needs `ListContent` permission instead.

### Setting for `TheAdmin` theme

New settings were added to the `TheAdmin` theme to allow you to make the admin theme responsive based on the screen size.

For example, adding the following settings in the `appsettings.json` file will produce the screencasts below:

```json
{
  "OrchardCore": {
    "TheAdminTheme": {
      "StyleSettings": {
        "WrapperClasses": "row mb-3",
        "LimitedWidthWrapperClasses": "row",
        "LimitedWidthClasses": "col-md-6 col-lg-5 col-xxl-4",
        "StartClasses": "col-lg-2 col-xl-3",
        "EndClasses": "col-lg-10 col-xl-9",
        "LabelClasses": "col-form-label text-lg-end col-lg-2 col-xl-3",
        "OffsetClasses": "offset-lg-2 offset-xl-3"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For a custom part or field editor to work with the new settings, you must update your view to use the new helpers:

1. Call the `Orchard.GetInputWrapperCssClasses()` helper to get the proper css classes for the input wrapper.
2. Call the `Orchard.GetLabelCssClasses()` helper to get the proper css classes for label elements.
3. Wrap all elements that correspond to the label with an element like `div` to group them. Then use the `Orchard.GetEndCssClasses()` helper to get the proper css classes for the new `div`.

For example, the `TitlePart.Edit.cshtml` view was changed from:

```
<div class="mb-3" asp-validation-class-for="Title">
    <label asp-for="Title">@T["Title"]</label>
    <input asp-for="Title" class="form-control content-preview-text content-caption-text" disabled="@(Model.Settings?.Options == TitlePartOptions.GeneratedDisabled)" autofocus="autofocus" dir="@culture.GetLanguageDirection()" />
    <span asp-validation-for="Title"></span>
    @if (!String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(Model.Settings?.Pattern))
    {
        switch (Model.Settings?.Options)
        {
            case TitlePartOptions.Editable:
                <span class="hint">@T["Leave empty to auto-generate the title using the pattern."]</span>
                break;
            case TitlePartOptions.GeneratedDisabled:
                <span class="hint">@T["The title will be auto-generated using the pattern."]</span>
                break;
        }
    }
</div>
```

to the following:

```
<!-- In the wrapper element we use the GetWrapperCssClasses() helper to get the proper classes. -->
<div class="@Orchard.GetWrapperCssClasses()" asp-validation-class-for="Title">
    <!-- The GetLabelCssClasses() helper is used in the label element. -->
    <label asp-for="Title" class="@Orchard.GetLabelCssClasses()">@T["Title"]</label>

    <!-- This div was added to group the corresponding element. Additionally, GetEndCssClasses() is used to get the proper classes. -->
    <div class="@Orchard.GetEndCssClasses()">
        <input asp-for="Title" class="form-control content-preview-text content-caption-text" disabled="@(Model.Settings?.Options == TitlePartOptions.GeneratedDisabled)" autofocus="autofocus" dir="@culture.GetLanguageDirection()" />
        <span asp-validation-for="Title"></span>
        @if (!String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(Model.Settings?.Pattern))
        {
            switch (Model.Settings?.Options)
            {
                case TitlePartOptions.Editable:
                    <span class="hint">@T["Leave empty to auto-generate the title using the pattern."]</span>
                    break;
                case TitlePartOptions.GeneratedDisabled:
                    <span class="hint">@T["The title will be auto-generated using the pattern."]</span>
                    break;
            }
        }
    </div>
</div>
```

Here is a list of all added helpers:

| Helper | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Orchard.GetWrapperCssClasses()` | gets the css classes for the wrapper element. |
| `Orchard.GetLabelCssClasses()` | gets the css classes for a label element. |
| `Orchard.GetStartCssClasses()` | gets the css classes for a starting section. For example, if you want to push your elements to the end to line it up with a label. |
| `Orchard.GetEndCssClasses()` | gets the css classes for the ending section. |
| `Orchard.GetEndCssClasses(bool withOffset)` | gets the css classes for the ending section with optionally an offset. |
| `Orchard.GetOffsetCssClasses()` | gets the offset classes to align the end elements. |
| `Orchard.GetLimitedWidthWrapperCssClasses()` | gets the css classes for the limited width element wrapper element. |
| `Orchard.GetLimitedWidthCssClasses()` | used for a field that has limited width, like the `number` element. For an example, look at the `NumericField.Edit.cshtml` view. |

### `OrchardCore.Search` Module

A new `Search Form` widget was added to allow you to add a search form as a widget to your site.

In addition to the default `/search` path, you can now use `/search/{indexName}` where `{indexName}` is the name of your search index.

The following views were added as a simpler way to override views as needed:

- `Search-List.cshtml` renders the search page.
- `Search-Form.cshtml` renders the form of the search form.
- `Search-Results.cshtml` renders the search results after the search is performed.
- `SearchFormPart.cshtml` renders the search form when `Search Form` is used.

### `OrchardCore.Search.Elasticsearch` Module

All [Built-in](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-analyzers.html) and custom analyzers are now supported. By default, only the `standard` analyzer is available. You may configure the Elasticsearch service to add all the built-in and custom analyzers as needed.

Additionally, a new setting named `IndexPrefix` was added to `OrchardCore_Elasticsearch` to allow defining a global prefix for all indexes. This is helpful in cases where an environment level index is needed.
