### Important Security Notice: Role Assignment Issue After Upgrade

If you have recently upgraded from a previous version of Orchard Core to version 2.1.0, 2.0.1, or 2.0.2, please be aware of a potential security issue that may impact your system. Specifically, if a role is assigned with **no permissions**, any user assigned to that role will automatically be granted the **Administrator** role after the upgrade, potentially giving them full access to your site.

#### Example Scenario:

Let's say your app includes a role named **Director**, which has no permissions assigned. If a user like **Mike** is assigned to this role, after the upgrade, **Mike** will automatically be granted the **Administrator** role, giving them full control over your site. This could pose a significant security risk if not addressed promptly.

#### Mitigation Steps:

To ensure your site's security, we strongly recommend that you review the users who currently have the **Administrator** role. If you find users who should not have administrative privileges, you should remove the **Administrator** role from their account immediately.

#### How to Check Users Assigned to the Administrator Role:

1. **Identify the Administrator Role:**
   - Go to the `/Admin/Roles/Index` page on your site. Check if the **Administrator** role has a **System** badge.  
   
   - If the **Administrator** role **has the System badge**, proceed with the following steps:
   
     1. Go to the `/Admin/Users/Index?q=role:Administrator` page.
     2. Review the list of users assigned the **Administrator** role.
     3. For any users who should not have **Administrator** privileges, click **Edit** on their account and remove the role.

   - If the **Administrator** role **does not have the System badge**, follow these steps:
   
     1. Look for the role with the **System** badge. This role is typically named **SiteOwner** or something similar (e.g., **SiteOwner1**, **SiteOwner2**, etc.).
     2. Once identified, replace `Site__Owner_RoleName_Goes_Here` with the correct role name and visit the `/Admin/Users/Index?q=role:{Site__Owner_RoleName_Goes_Here}` page on your site.
     3. Review the list of users with the site owner role.
     4. For any users who should not have site owner privileges, click **Edit** on their account and remove the role.

### Final Reminder:

We recommend that you take immediate action to verify user roles and ensure that only authorized users have administrative or site owner access. Failing to do so could expose your application to significant security risks.
