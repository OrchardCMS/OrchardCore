# Orchard Core 3.0.0

Release date: Not yet released

Before upgrading from version 2 to v3, it is important to first compile your project using the latest available v2 version, resolve any warnings, and then proceed with the upgrade to v3.

## Breaking Changes

### Content Module

In the previous versions you need to use `OrhardCore` namespace in Razor pages or views whenever you want to access the content helpers that provided by `IOrchardHelper` which is unlike the other services that you can access directly without the need to use the namespace. In this version, we have removed the need to use the `OrchardCore` namespace in Razor pages or views to access the content helpers. You can now access the content helpers directly without the need to use the `OrchardCore` namespace.

The `ContentRazorHelperExtensions` has been replaced by `ContentOrchardHelperExtensions`.

### Liquid Module

#### Liquid Tag Disabled by Default

For reliability and performance reasons, the `liquid` tag has been disabled by default in Liquid templates. 

To re-enable the `liquid` tag, you can configure it in your `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "OrchardCore_Liquid": {
    "AllowLiquidTags": true
  }
}
```

### YesSql Changes

Previously, we configured YesSql with the `ReadUncommitted` isolation level. We have now set `ReadCommitted` as the default and made it configurable through settings.

### Email Module

Previously, emails sent from Orchard Core could have either a plain text body, or an HTML body, but not both. Now, they can have both. This also brings some code-level API changes, see below.

When interacting with email-related services from code, `MailMessage`, the class representing an e-mail, exposed a `string` `Body` property. This could contain either plain text or HTML, which was indicated by `IsHtmlBody`.

These two properties have now been replaced by the `TextBody` and `HtmlBody` properties, which contains a plain text and/or HTML body.

### GraphQL Module

#### GraphQL Library Upgrade

The `GraphQL` libraries have been upgraded from version 7 to version 8. Below are important changes and considerations for your implementation:

1. **Removal of Default Implementation**:  
   The `IContentTypeBuilder` interface previously included a default implementation for the `Clear()` method. This implementation has been removed. If you have a custom implementation of `IContentTypeBuilder`, you must now provide your own `Clear()` method. The method can remain empty if no specific actions are needed.

2. **Sealed Classes**:  
   Several classes have been marked as sealed to prevent further inheritance. This change is intended to enhance stability and maintainability. The following classes are now sealed:

   - All implementations of `InputObjectGraphType`
   - All implementations of `ObjectGraphType<>`
   - All implementations of `WhereInputObjectGraphType`
   - All implementations of `DynamicContentTypeBuilder`
   - All implementations of `IContentTypeBuilder`
   - All implementations of `GraphQLFilter`
   - All implementations of `ISchemaBuilder`

### Indexing Module

- The interface `IContentItemIndexHandler` was renamed to `IDocumentIndexHandler`.
- The `IndexingConstants` class was renamed to `ContentIndexingConstants`.
- The `BuildIndexContext` class was renamed to `BuildDocumentIndexContext`.
- In the `BuildDocumentIndexContext` class, the `ContentItem` property was removed. Instead, you should use the new `Record` property. You may check if `Record` in `ContentItem` like this:

```
if(context.Record is ContentItem contentItem) {
    // Do something with contentItem
})
```

- The `IIndexingTaskManager` interface was changed to be use as a universal task manager not only for content items. If you want to queue the content items in the index manager, you'll need to pass `Content` in the category argument. You may also store non-content-items in the index manager by passing a different category name.

!!! warning
    The `IndexingTask` table in the database has been migrated to `RecordIndexingTask` to better reflect its purpose as a universal task manager. The `IndexingTask` table is kept intact to allow you to rollback your deployment if needed. If you no longer need that table, you can either manually delete it or create a migration in your project that deletes it.

### Elasticsearch Module

#### Deprecation of the NEST Library

We previously relied on the [NEST](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NEST) library to interface with the Elasticsearch service. However, due to the deprecation of NEST, we have migrated to its successor, [Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch). As part of this transition, the following interfaces and classes have been removed:

- `IElasticAnalyzer`
- `IElasticSearchQueryService` (use `ElasticsearchQueryService` as an alternative)
- `ElasticAnalyzer`

To ensure consistency across our codebase, all classes and interfaces are now prefixed with `Elasticsearch` instead of `Elastic` or `ElasticSearch`. The only exception to this naming convention is for settings, which have been retained to minimize further breaking changes.

Additionally, the `OrchardCore.Search.Elasticsearch.Abstractions` project has been removed, and the following classes have been relocated to the `OrchardCore.Search.Elasticsearch.Core` project:

- `ElasticsearchOptions`
- `ElasticsearchQueryResults`
- `ElasticsearchTopDocs`

The method `ExecuteQueryAsync(string indexName, Query query, List<SortOptions> sort, int from, int size)` has been removed from the `ElasticsearchQueryService` class. In its place, we have introduced the new method `GetContentItemIdsAsync(ElasticsearchSearchContext request)`, which streamlines the query execution process by encapsulating the necessary parameters within a single context object.

### Search Highlights

The latest update introduces support for **Search Highlights** in Elasticsearch queries. When highlights are enabled, Elasticsearch will return relevant text segments that match the search term, allowing for a more contextual and user-friendly search result display.

#### Example Elasticsearch Query

Here's an example of how to configure the Elasticsearch query to include highlights:

```json
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match": {
      "fields": [
        "Content.ContentItem.FullText"
      ],
      "query": "{{ term }}",
      "fuzziness": "AUTO"
    }
  },
  "highlight": {
    "pre_tags": [
      "<span style='background-color: #FFF3CD;'>"
    ],
    "post_tags": [
      "</span>"
    ],
    "fields": {
      "Content.ContentItem.FullText": {
        "fragment_size": 150,
        "number_of_fragments": 3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With this feature, Elasticsearch will return highlighted fragments wrapped in custom HTML tags, which can then be displayed in the Search module or other components. This enables the presentation of more relevant content that directly matches the search term.

!!! note
    Highlights request only work when the content item is stored in Elasticsearch service.

### Total Hits Count Support

The latest update adds support for **Total Hits Count** in Elasticsearch queries. When a query includes `track_total_hits: true`, the response will report the **total number of documents matching the query**, rather than just the number of documents returned in the current page.

### Search Feature

The signature in the `ISearchService` interface was changed from `Task<SearchResult> SearchAsync(string indexName, string term, int start, int size)` to `Task<SearchResult> SearchAsync(IndexEntity index, string term, int start, int size)`.

The route `/search/{indexName?}` was change to accept index id instead of name. The route is now `/search/{indexId?}`. This change was made to ensure that the search functionality works correctly with the new `IndexEntity` class, which is now used to represent indexes in the system.

The default search settings was changed to require default index-id instead of a provider name.

### Azure Search AI Module  

With the improvement done to the Indexing module, managing Azure AI Search indexes is now part of the indexing module. This change reduced the code complexity and simplify the user experience since we now have one UI for all indexes. Another advantage is that we are now able to add data sources other than contents.

### Lucene Module  

With the improvement done to the Indexing module, managing Lucene indexes is now part of the indexing module. This change reduced the code complexity and simplify the user experience since we now have one UI for all indexes. Another advantage is that we are now able to add data sources other than contents.

#### Azure Search AI Breaking Change Summary

There are lots of binary breaking changes in the Azure Search AI module most won't impact you. The following change will impact you:

- The permission `AzureAISearchPermissions.ManageAzureAISearchIndexes` was removed and the `AzureAISearchPermissions.ManageAzureAISearchISettings` was added.

### Taxonomies Module

In previous releases, taxonomy listings on the frontend used a simplified pager with only **Next** and **Previous** buttons. As of this release, the pager has been upgraded to a **full-featured pagination control**, allowing users to jump directly to specific pages.

If your project overrides the `TermPart` view and modifies the `Model.Shape`, ensure your customization is compatible with the new shape type introduced by this change.

Additionally, a new interface, `IContentsTaxonomyListFilter`, has been introduced. This interface allows developers to customize or modify the query used when retrieving taxonomies, providing greater flexibility and control over taxonomy listings.

### Users Module

The user registration and login functionalities have been refactored for better extensibility:

- **Registration Improvements**:  
  - The `IRegistrationFormEvents` interface now includes `Task RegisteringAsync(UserRegisteringContext context)` for streamlined customization.  
  - A new base class, `RegistrationFormEventsBase`, allows developers to override only necessary methods.

- **Login Improvements**:  
  - The `ILoginFormEvent` interface has a new method: `Task<IActionResult> ValidatingLoginAsync(IUser user)`.  
  - The `LoginFormEventBase` class enables overriding relevant methods. Note that the base implementation of `LoggingInAsync()` has been removed; you must now implement this method if using `LoginFormEventBase`.

- **User Service Update**:  
  - A new method in `IUserService` interface: `Task<IUser> RegisterAsync(RegisterUserForm model, Action<string, string> reportError)` facilitates registration with error reporting.

These enhancements make the user management system more modular and customizable.

#### Removed Old Settings

The following obsolete settings were removed from `RegistrationSettings` class

- `NoPasswordForExternalUsers`
- `NoUsernameForExternalUsers`
- `NoEmailForExternalUsers`
- `UseScriptToGenerateUsername`
- `GenerateUsernameScript`
- `UsersCanRegister`

The following obsolete settings were removed from `LoginSettings` class

- `UseExternalProviderIfOnlyOneDefined`
- `UseScriptToSyncRoles`
- `SyncRolesScript`

#### Login View Update

The `ExternalLogin` action has been removed from the `Account` controller. If you are using a custom `Login.cshtml` view or `Login` template, please update the external login form action. As of this update, the `ExternalLogin` action has been relocated to the `ExternalAuthentications` controller.

#### AssignRoleToUsers Permission Update

The `AssignRoleToUsers` permission is no longer implicitly granted by `EditUsers`. To maintain the same behavior, make sure to explicitly assign the `AssignRoleToUsers` permission to any role that already has the `EditUsers` permission.

#### The Behavior of 'has_claim' Liquid Filter Changed.

The `Administrator` role no longer registers permission-based claims by default during login. This means that directly checking for specific claims in Liquid, such as:

```liquid
{% assign isAuthorized = User | has_claim: "Permission", "AccessAdminPanel" %}
```

will return `false` for administrators, even though they still have full access. Non-admin users, however, may return `true` if they have the claim.  It's important to use the `has_permission` filter for permission checks going forward:

```liquid
{% assign isAuthorized = User | has_permission: "AccessAdminPanel" %}
```

#### LoginForm_Edit Shape Type Modification

To simplify the `LoginForm.Edit.cshtml` view, the following code has been moved to `Views/Account/Login.cshtml`:

```html
<h1 class="fs-4">@T["Log in"]</h1>
<hr />
```

#### Enabling & Disabling Users

To centralize user activation and deactivation, the **"Is enabled?"** checkbox has been removed from the Edit User form. Instead, you can now enable or disable a user directly from the **Users List** by clicking the **Actions** button next to the user and selecting **"Enable"** or **"Disable"**.

To support this change, two new methods—`EnableAsync()` and `DisableAsync()`—have been added to `IUserService`, providing a more standardized approach to managing user status.

### ReCaptcha

In the previous implementation, the ReCaptcha module supported two modes: `AlwaysShow` and `PreventRobots`. To simplify the module and enhance integration, the `PreventRobots` mode and its related components have been removed. Going forward, **only the `AlwaysShow` mode** will be supported.

As part of this update, the following components have been deprecated and removed:

- `IDetectRobots`
- `IPAddressRobotDetector`
- `ReCaptchaMode`

Furthermore, the `ReCaptchaService` class has been sealed to prevent inheritance. The following methods have also been removed:

- `MaybeThisIsARobot`
- `IsThisARobot`
- `ThisIsAHuman`

Previously, the `FormReCaptcha` view was available to inject a ReCaptcha challenge from any display driver. This view has been removed. The recommended approach now is to return a shape directly, as shown below:

```csharp
return Dynamic("ReCaptcha", (m) =>
{
    m.language = CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture.Name;
}).Location("Content:after");
```

Instead of using this approach:

```csharp
return View("FormReCaptcha", model).Location("Content:after");
```

If you still need to render ReCaptcha using the deprecated `FormReCaptcha`, you can manually add the `FormReCaptcha.cshtml` view to your project. Here's the code for this:

```html
<div class="mb-3">
    <captcha mode="AlwaysShow" language="@Orchard.CultureName()" />
</div>
``` 

This change is designed to simplify your integration process and make it easier to manage ReCaptcha usage in your project.

### Content Module  

#### UpdateAsync No Longer Triggered During Creation

Previously, the `IContentHandler.UpdatingAsync` and `IContentHandler.UpdatedAsync` methods were triggered for both creation and update events. This behavior has been corrected in this release. Now, if you are modifying or altering content items within the `UpdatingAsync` or `UpdatedAsync` handlers, you must also implement the `Creating` or `Created` events to maintain the previous functionality.  

Additionally, when manually creating or updating content items in your project, ensure that you use `ContentManager.CreateAsync` exclusively for creating new items and `ContentManager.UpdateAsync` for updating existing ones. This guarantees that the `Creating`, `Created`, `Updating`, and `Updated` events are triggered appropriately.

#### New CollapseContainedItems Setting for Contained Item Behavior

A new **CollapseContainedItems** setting has been added to **BagPartSettings** and **FlowPartSettings**, allowing users to control whether contained items are collapsed or expanded by default. To ensure consistency, both **BagPart** and **FlowPart** now default to expanding contained items when the page loads.

### GitHub Module

We have migrated to using the [AspNet.Security.OAuth.GitHub](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNet.Security.OAuth.GitHub) package to simplify and reduce the amount of custom code required for GitHub integration. As part of this change, the following classes have been **removed**:

- `GithubDefault` — replaced by the library's `GitHubAuthenticationDefaults`.
- `GithubOptions` — replaced by the library's `GitHubAuthenticationOptions`.
- `GithubHandler` — replaced by the library's `GitHubAuthenticationHandler`.

In addition, the `IGithubAuthenticationService` interface has been **removed**.  
If you need to access the GitHub authentication settings, you can now do so by:

- Resolving `IOptions<GitHubAuthenticationOptions>`, or
- Using `ISiteService` to retrieve the site's configuration.

### OrchardRazorHelperExtensions Class Names

To resolve CS0433 naming conflicts, the `OrchardRazorHelperExtensions` classes across multiple modules have been renamed to follow a consistent naming pattern:

- `OrchardCore.ContentManagement.Display` → `ContentOrchardRazorHelperExtensions`
- `OrchardCore.Media` → `MediaOrchardRazorHelperExtensions`
- `OrchardCore.Shortcodes` → `ShortcodesOrchardRazorHelperExtensions`

**Impact**: Extension methods continue to work identically in Razor views (`@Orchard.AssetUrl()`, `@Orchard.ConsoleLog()`, etc.). This change only affects projects that directly reference these class names in code.

### Display Management

The Display Management subsystem received performance-focused refactoring. The following API changes may require code updates:

- FeatureShapeDescriptor sealed: `FeatureShapeDescriptor` is now sealed. Do not inherit from it.
- Removed BindingSources properties:
  - Removed `ShapeMetadata.BindingSources`.
  - Removed `ShapeDescriptor.BindingSources` and the corresponding override on descriptor index types. If you relied on these, inspect `ShapeDescriptor.Bindings` to infer binding sources.
- ShapeBinding sealed: `ShapeBinding` is now sealed and its `BindingAsync` property is no longer virtual. Do not inherit from `ShapeBinding` or override its members.
- Non-virtual Binding members: `ShapeDescriptor.BindingSource` and `ShapeDescriptor.Binding` are no longer virtual. Use the `ShapeAlterationBuilder` events or display drivers to customize binding behavior.
- Binding behavior: `ShapeDescriptor.Binding` now returns `null` if no binding exists instead of throwing. Add null checks when accessing a shape's binding.
- Placement default initialization changed: `ShapeDescriptor.Placement` now lazily falls back to the default placement action if not set. This should be transparent, but code that assumed `Placement` was preset may need to handle a possibly null delegate before first access.
- ShapeDescriptorIndex sealed: `ShapeDescriptorIndex` is now sealed. Do not inherit from it.

## Change Log

### Localization Module

#### Fallback to Parent Culture

The `Localization` module allows the user to control the fallback to the parent culture when a translation is not available in the current culture. The default behavior in ASP.NET Core is that the culture automatically falls back to its parent if not exist, but now you have the control to make this feature on or off.

### Reverse Proxy Module

#### Known Networks & Proxies

The `Reverse Proxy` module has been updated to include a new setting called **Known Networks & Proxies**. This setting allows you to specify trusted networks and proxies that can be used to determine the user's IP address. This is particularly useful when your application is behind a reverse proxy or load balancer, ensuring that the correct client IP address is captured.

### Roles Module

#### Permission Behavior Added to Roles Recipe Step

The `Roles` recipe now includes the ability to define specific permission behaviors, allowing you to control how permissions are managed within a role. The following behaviors are available:

- **Replace**: This behavior removes all existing permissions associated with the role and replaces them with the new permissions from the `Permissions` collection. This is the default behavior.
- **Add**: This behavior adds the new permission(s) from the `Permissions` collection to the role, but only if they do not already exist. It does not affect the existing permissions.
- **Remove**: This behavior removes the specified permission(s) in the `Permissions` collection from the role's existing permissions.

For more info about the new `PermissionBehavior`, check out the [documentation](../reference/modules/Roles/README.md).

### Users Module

#### Email Confirmation Process Update

In the past, administrators could confirm user's email by editing their details and checking the **Confirm Email** box. This process has now been updated. 

To confirm a user's email, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Users List**.
2. Locate the user you wish to confirm.
3. Click on the **Actions** menu next to the user.
4. Select the **Confirm email** option.

This change streamlines the email confirmation process by moving it out of the user edit form, offering a more straightforward approach to user management.

!!! note
    The **Confirm email** option will only be visible if the user has not yet been confirmed.

### Search Module

The Search Module now supports **Highlights**. If the search service provider supports Highlights, they will be rendered by default. If Highlights are unavailable, the module will fall back to displaying the `ContentItem` in a **Summary** display type.

### ReCaptcha Module

#### New ReCaptcha Shape

A new `ReCaptcha` shape has been introduced, enabling you to render the ReCaptcha challenge using a customizable shape. For more details, please refer to the [documentation](../reference/modules/ReCaptcha/README.md).

### Menu Module

#### Permission-Based Menu Visibility

The Menu module enables you to build frontend menus for your users through a user-friendly interface. We've enhanced this feature by allowing you to require one or more permissions before a menu item becomes visible to the user.

If you're using a custom `MenuItem` in your project and want to incorporate this functionality, you can achieve it by attaching the `MenuItemPermissionPart` to your custom `MenuItem` content type.

When caching your menu, it's crucial to include the `cache-context` to ensure the menu is properly cached and invalidated based on the user's roles. This ensures the menu is displayed correctly for each logged-in user, based on their specific roles. 

For example, here's how you can add the menu with `cache-context` using Razor:

```razor
<menu alias="alias:main-menu" cache-id="main-menu" cache-fixed-duration="00:05:00" cache-tag="alias:main-menu" cache-context="user.roles" />
```

Notice the `cache-context="user.roles"` attribute.

Alternatively, here's how you can implement the same functionality using Liquid:

```liquid
{% shape "menu", alias: "alias:main-menu", cache_id: "main-menu", cache_fixed_duration: "00:05:00", cache_tag: "alias:main-menu", cache_context: "user.roles" %}
```

Again, notice the inclusion of `cache_context: "user.roles"`.

By default, permissions are enabled for new tenants. However, if you'd like to add permissions to an existing tenant, you can use the "Add Permissions to Menus" recipe either through the UI or by executing the recipe programmatically as shown below:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "recipes",
      "Values": [
        {
          "executionid": "MenuAddPermissions",
          "name": "MenuAddPermissions"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

!!! note
    Be sure to update all instances where you create a menu shape by adding the cache-context attribute. This ensures the menu is properly cached and tailored based on the user's roles.

#### Permission-Based Content Menu Visibility

A new option, **Check content permissions**, has been added to the **Content Menu Item**. This feature allows you to control the visibility of a menu item based on the user's permissions. When this option is enabled, the system ensures that the current user has the `View Content` permission for the selected item before displaying it.

### Asset Manager

Orchard Core now features a new Asset Manager, set to gradually replace the Gulp pipeline. While the Gulp pipeline remains for backward compatibility during the transition and refactoring period, a comprehensive documentation is available to guide users on the new Asset Manager.

The Gulp pipeline is being phased out as it is no longer suitable for bundling assets with tools like Webpack. The new Asset Manager leverages Concurrently, enabling the execution of shell commands directly from Node.js.This provides flexibility to use APIs from bundlers, compilers, and transpilers to perform various actions seamlessly.

For more information, see [the corresponding page](../guides/assets-manager/README.md).

### Admin Theme

The Admin Theme ResourceManagementOptionsConfiguration.cs file is now changed. We renamed "admin" assets to "the-admin" for ease of maintenance of dependencies in the solution.

### Indexing Module

The `Indexing` module has been refactored to improve extensibility and maintainability. Key enhancements include:

- Introduced new **Vector** and **Complex** data types for indexing, enabling advanced search capabilities.
  * The **Vector** type supports vector-based indexing and similarity search, allowing efficient retrieval based on vector embeddings.
  * The **Complex** type enables indexing of structured or nested objects, offering greater flexibility for modeling rich data schemas.

- All indexes from multiple providers—such as Elasticsearch, Azure AI Search, and Lucene—are now centrally registered and managed through the new **Indexes** interface, accessible via `Search` > `Indexes`.

The following recipe steps were added to allow you to manage any index profile.
  * `CreateOrUpdateIndexProfile` allows you to create or update index profile.
  * `ResetIndex` allows you to reset an index.
  * `RebuildIndex` allows you to rebuild an index.

Search index-specific permissions were centralized into the Indexing module. Thus every index gets a dynamically created "Query 'index name' Index" permission. Use these to allow specific user roles to query the index, and thus also use the frontend search feature.

!!! warning
    You need to update user roles and recipes to use the new permissions. If you e.g. allow Anonymous users to use the frontend search feature, not doing so will prevent such users from searching.
  
#### Enhanced Multi-Source Indexing  

To create a custom source, you'll need to implement the `IIndexManager`, `IDocumentIndexManager` and `IIndexNameProvider` interfaces and register them as following

To register a new source, you can add the following code to your `Startup.cs` file:

```csharp
// Currently we support 'AzureAISearch', 'Elasticsearch', and 'Lucene' providers.
services.AddIndexingSource<CustomSourceIndexManager, CustomSourceDocumentIndexManager, CustomSourceIndexNameProvider>("ProviderName", "CustomSource", o =>
{
    o.DisplayName = S["Custom Source in Provider"];
    o.Description = S["Create a Provider index based on custom source."];
});
```

### Elasticsearch Module  

The following recipe steps were deprecated:

- Both `elastic-index` and `ElasticIndexSettings` steps, which was used to create a Elasticsearch index. Instead, please use the `CreateOrUpdateIndexProfile` step to create or update an index.
- `elastic-index-reset` step, which was used to create a Elasticsearch query. Instead, please use the `ResetIndex` step to create a query.
- `elastic-index-rebuild` step, which was used to create a Elasticsearch query. Instead, please use the `RebuildIndex` step to create a query.

!!! note
    The `elastic-index`, `ElasticIndexSettings`, `elastic-index-reset`, and `elastic-index-rebuild` steps are still available for backward compatibility, but they are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We recommend you update your recipes by setting up a site with your current ones, then creating a Deployment Plan with the new steps to export the configuration in the new format.

#### Multiple Authentication Types for Elasticsearch

Now, the Elasticsearch module supports multiple authentication types for connecting to the Elasticsearch server. You can now choose between the following authentication methods:

- `Basic`: For basic authentication, you need to provide a `Username` and `Password`.
- `ApiKey`: For API key authentication, you need to provide an `ApiKey`.
- `Base64ApiKey`: For base64-encoded API key authentication, you need to provide a `Base64ApiKey` API key.
- `KeyIdAndKey`: For key ID and key authentication, you need to provide a `KeyId` and `Key`.

### Lucene Module  

The following recipe steps were deprecated:

- Both `lucene-index` and `LuceneIndexSettings` steps, which was used to create a Lucene index. Instead, please use the `CreateOrUpdateIndexProfile` step to create or update an index.
- `lucene-index-reset` step, which was used to create a Lucene query. Instead, please use the `ResetIndex` step to create a query.
- `lucene-index-rebuild` step, which was used to create a Lucene query. Instead, please use the `RebuildIndex` step to create a query.

!!! note
    The `lucene-index`, `LuceneIndexSettings`, `lucene-index-reset`, and `lucene-index-rebuild` steps are still available for backward compatibility, but they are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We recommend you update your recipes by setting up a site with your current ones, then creating a Deployment Plan with the new steps to export the configuration in the new format.

### Font Awesome

Font Awesome was updated to version 7.0.0. Some changes may be required in your templates. Please follow the instructions from [the changelog](https://fontawesome.com/changelog).

## Miscellaneous

### Shapes

A new Razor helper method has been introduced to simplify morphing shapes directly within Razor views. You can now use `@DisplayAsAsync(Model, "NewShapeType")` to render the current model as a different shape type.

### Sealing Types

Many type commonly used by classes can be `sealed`, which improves runtime performance. While it's not mandatory, we recommend that you consider applying this improvement to your own extensions as well. We've implemented this enhancement in pull request [#16897](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/16897).

### New Extension Method for Adding `IConfigureOptions<ResourceManagementOptions>` Implementations

When adding an `IConfigureOptions<ResourceManagementOptions>` implementation, used to add static resources and commonly named `ResourceManagementOptionsConfiguration`, you previously had to do the following in the `Startup` classes:

```csharp
services.AddTransient<IConfigureOptions<ResourceManagementOptions>, ResourceManagementOptionsConfiguration>();
```

To simplify this, we introduced a new extension method to do the same in a shorter form:

```csharp
services.AddResourceConfiguration<ResourceManagementOptionsConfiguration>();
```

You can utilize this in your codebase by searching the `AddTransient<IConfigureOptions<ResourceManagementOptions>, (.+)>\(\)` regex pattern and replacing it with `AddResourceConfiguration<$1>()`. Projects using this have to reference the `OrchardCore.ResourceManagement` package.

### Shapes

#### User Display Name Shape

A new shape, `UserDisplayName` has been introduced to render a user's display name. For more info, see [the documentation](../reference/modules/Users/README.md).
