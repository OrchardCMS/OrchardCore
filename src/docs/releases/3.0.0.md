# Orchard Core 3.0.0

Release date: Not yet released

Before upgrading from version 2 to v3, it is important to first compile your project using the latest available v2 version, resolve any warnings, and then proceed with the upgrade to v3.

## Breaking Changes

### GraphQL Module

#### GraphQL Library Upgrade

The `GraphQL` libraries have been upgraded from version 7 to version 8. Below are important changes and considerations for your implementation:

1. **Removal of Default Implementation**:  
   The `IContentTypeBuilder` interface previously included a default implementation for the `Clear()` method. This implementation has been removed. If you have a custom implementation of `IContentTypeBuilder`, you must now provide your own `Clear()` method. The method can remain empty if no specific actions are needed.

2. **Sealed Classes**:  
   Several classes have been marked as sealed to prevent further inheritance. This change is intended to enhance stability and maintainability. The following classes are now sealed:

   - All implementations of `InputObjectGraphType`
   - All implementations of `ObjectGraphType<>`
   - All implementations of `WhereInputObjectGraphType`
   - All implementations of `DynamicContentTypeBuilder`
   - All implementations of `IContentTypeBuilder`
   - All implementations of `GraphQLFilter`
   - All implementations of `ISchemaBuilder`
   
### Elasticsearch Module

#### Deprecation of the NEST Library

We previously relied on the [NEST](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NEST) library to interface with the Elasticsearch service. However, due to the deprecation of NEST, we have migrated to its successor, [Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch). As part of this transition, the following interfaces and classes have been removed:

- `IElasticAnalyzer`
- `IElasticSearchQueryService` (use `ElasticsearchQueryService` as an alternative)
- `ElasticAnalyzer`

To ensure consistency across our codebase, all classes and interfaces are now prefixed with `Elasticsearch` instead of `Elastic` or `ElasticSearch`. The only exception to this naming convention is for settings, which have been retained to minimize further breaking changes.

Additionally, the `OrchardCore.Search.Elasticsearch.Abstractions` project has been removed, and the following classes have been relocated to the `OrchardCore.Search.Elasticsearch.Core` project:

- `ElasticsearchOptions`
- `ElasticsearchQueryResults`
- `ElasticsearchTopDocs`

The method `ExecuteQueryAsync(string indexName, Query query, List<SortOptions> sort, int from, int size)` has been removed from the `ElasticsearchQueryService` class. In its place, we have introduced the new method `GetContentItemIdsAsync(ElasticsearchSearchContext request)`, which streamlines the query execution process by encapsulating the necessary parameters within a single context object.

### Users Module

The user registration and login functionalities have been refactored for better extensibility:

- **Registration Improvements**:  
  - The `IRegistrationFormEvents` interface now includes `Task RegisteringAsync(UserRegisteringContext context)` for streamlined customization.  
  - A new base class, `RegistrationFormEventsBase`, allows developers to override only necessary methods.

- **Login Improvements**:  
  - The `ILoginFormEvent` interface has a new method: `Task<IActionResult> ValidatingLoginAsync(IUser user)`.  
  - The `LoginFormEventBase` class enables overriding relevant methods. Note that the base implementation of `LoggingInAsync()` has been removed; you must now implement this method if using `LoginFormEventBase`.

- **User Service Update**:  
  - A new method in `IUserService` interface: `Task<IUser> RegisterAsync(RegisterUserForm model, Action<string, string> reportError)` facilitates registration with error reporting.

These enhancements make the user management system more modular and customizable.

#### Removed old settings

The following obsolete settings were removed from `RegistrationSettings` class

- `NoPasswordForExternalUsers`
- `NoUsernameForExternalUsers`
- `NoEmailForExternalUsers`
- `UseScriptToGenerateUsername`
- `GenerateUsernameScript`
- `UsersCanRegister`

The following obsolete settings were removed from `LoginSettings` class

- `UseExternalProviderIfOnlyOneDefined`
- `UseScriptToSyncRoles`
- `SyncRolesScript`

#### Login View Update

The `ExternalLogin` action has been removed from the `Account` controller. If you are using a custom `Login.cshtml` view or `Login` template, please update the external login form action. As of this update, the `ExternalLogin` action has been relocated to the `ExternalAuthentications` controller.

#### AssignRoleToUsers Permission Update

The `AssignRoleToUsers` permission is no longer implicitly granted by `EditUsers`. To maintain the same behavior, make sure to explicitly assign the `AssignRoleToUsers` permission to any role that already has the `EditUsers` permission.

#### The Behavior of 'has_claim' Liquid Filter Changed.

The `Administrator` role no longer registers permission-based claims by default during login. This means that directly checking for specific claims in Liquid, such as:

```liquid
{% assign isAuthorized = User | has_claim: "Permission", "AccessAdminPanel" %}
```

will return `false` for administrators, even though they still have full access. Non-admin users, however, may return `true` if they have the claim.  It's important to use the `has_permission` filter for permission checks going forward:

```liquid
{% assign isAuthorized = User | has_permission: "AccessAdminPanel" %}
```

### ReCaptcha

In the previous implementation, the ReCaptcha module supported two modes: `AlwaysShow` and `PreventRobots`. To simplify the module and enhance integration, the `PreventRobots` mode and its related components have been removed. Going forward, **only the `AlwaysShow` mode** will be supported.

As part of this update, the following components have been deprecated and removed:

- `IDetectRobots`
- `IPAddressRobotDetector`
- `ReCaptchaMode`

Furthermore, the `ReCaptchaService` class has been sealed to prevent inheritance. The following methods have also been removed:

- `MaybeThisIsARobot`
- `IsThisARobot`
- `ThisIsAHuman`

Previously, the `FormReCaptcha` view was available to inject a ReCaptcha challenge from any display driver. This view has been removed. The recommended approach now is to return a shape directly, as shown below:

```csharp
return Dynamic("ReCaptcha", (m) =>
{
    m.language = CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture.Name;
}).Location("Content:after");
```

Instead of using this approach:

```csharp
return View("FormReCaptcha", model).Location("Content:after");
```

If you still need to render ReCaptcha using the deprecated `FormReCaptcha`, you can manually add the `FormReCaptcha.cshtml` view to your project. Here's the code for this:

```html
<div class="mb-3">
    <captcha mode="AlwaysShow" language="@Orchard.CultureName()" />
</div>
``` 

This change is designed to simplify your integration process and make it easier to manage ReCaptcha usage in your project.

## Change Log

### Roles Module

#### Permission Behavior Added to Roles Recipe Step

The `Roles` recipe now includes the ability to define specific permission behaviors, allowing you to control how permissions are managed within a role. The following behaviors are available:

- **Replace**: This behavior removes all existing permissions associated with the role and replaces them with the new permissions from the `Permissions` collection. This is the default behavior.
- **Add**: This behavior adds the new permission(s) from the `Permissions` collection to the role, but only if they do not already exist. It does not affect the existing permissions.
- **Remove**: This behavior removes the specified permission(s) in the `Permissions` collection from the roleâ€™s existing permissions.

For more info about the new `PermissionBehavior`, check out the [documentation](../reference/modules/Roles/README.md).
 
### ReCaptcha Module

#### New ReCaptcha Shape

A new `ReCaptcha` shape has been introduced, enabling you to render the ReCaptcha challenge using a customizable shape. For more details, please refer to the [documentation](../reference/modules/ReCaptcha/README.md).

### Menu Module

#### Permission-Based Menu Visibility

The Menu module enables you to build frontend menus for your users through a user-friendly interface. We've enhanced this feature by allowing you to require one or more permissions before a menu item becomes visible to the user.

If you're using a custom `MenuItem` in your project and want to incorporate this functionality, you can achieve it by attaching the `MenuItemPermissionPart` to your custom `MenuItem` content type.

When caching your menu, it's crucial to include the `cache-context` to ensure the menu is properly cached and invalidated based on the user's roles. This ensures the menu is displayed correctly for each logged-in user, based on their specific roles. 

For example, here's how you can add the menu with `cache-context` using Razor:

```razor
<menu alias="alias:main-menu" cache-id="main-menu" cache-fixed-duration="00:05:00" cache-tag="alias:main-menu" cache-context="user.roles" />
```

Notice the `cache-context="user.roles"` attribute.

Alternatively, here's how you can implement the same functionality using Liquid:

```liquid
{% shape "menu", alias: "alias:main-menu", cache_id: "main-menu", cache_fixed_duration: "00:05:00", cache_tag: "alias:main-menu", cache_context: "user.roles" %}
```

Again, notice the inclusion of `cache_context: "user.roles"`.

By default, permissions are enabled for new tenants. However, if you'd like to add permissions to an existing tenant, you can use the "Add Permissions to Menus" recipe either through the UI or by executing the recipe programmatically as shown below:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "recipes",
      "Values": [
        {
          "executionid": "MenuAddPermissions",
          "name": "MenuAddPermissions"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

!!! note
    Be sure to update all instances where you create a menu shape by adding the cache-context attribute. This ensures the menu is properly cached and tailored based on the user's roles.

#### Permission-Based Content Menu Visibility

A new option, **Check content permissions**, has been added to the **Content Menu Item**. This feature allows you to control the visibility of a menu item based on the user's permissions. When this option is enabled, the system ensures that the current user has the `View Content` permission for the selected item before displaying it.

## Miscellaneous

### Sealing Types

Many type commonly used by classes can be `sealed`, which improves runtime performance. While it's not mandatory, we recommend that you consider applying this improvement to your own extensions as well. We've implemented this enhancement in pull request [#16897](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/16897).

### New Extension Method for Adding `IConfigureOptions<ResourceManagementOptions>` Implementations

When adding an `IConfigureOptions<ResourceManagementOptions>` implementation, used to add static resources and commonly named `ResourceManagementOptionsConfiguration`, you previously had to do the following in the `Startup` classes:

```csharp
services.AddTransient<IConfigureOptions<ResourceManagementOptions>, ResourceManagementOptionsConfiguration>();
```

To simplify this, we introduced a new extension method to do the same in a shorter form:

```csharp
services.AddResourceConfiguration<ResourceManagementOptionsConfiguration>();
```

You can utilize this in your codebase by searching the `AddTransient<IConfigureOptions<ResourceManagementOptions>, (.+)>\(\)` regex pattern and replacing it with `AddResourceConfiguration<$1>()`. Projects using this have to reference the `OrchardCore.ResourceManagement` package.
