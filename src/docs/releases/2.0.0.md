# Orchard Core 2.0.0

Release date: Not yet released

## Important Upgrade Instructions

Prior to making the leap to Orchard Core 2.0, it's crucial to follow a step-by-step upgrade process. Begin by upgrading your current version to 1.8, resolving any obsolete warnings encountered along the way, and guaranteeing that every site successfully operates on version 1.8.3. This approach ensures that all sites are seamlessly transitioned to 1.8. Subsequently, proceed with confidence to upgrade to 2.0. Prior to initiating this upgrade, thoroughly review the documented list of breaking changes provided below to facilitate a smooth and hassle-free transition.

## Breaking Changes

### Drop `Newtonsoft.Json` Support

The utilization of [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json) has been discontinued in both **YesSql** and **OrchardCore**. Instead, we have transitioned to utilize `System.Text.Json` due to its enhanced performance capabilities. To ensure compatibility with `System.Text.Json` during the serialization or deserialization of objects, the following steps need to be undertaken:

  - If you are using a custom deployment steps, change how you register it by using the new `AddDeployment<>` extension. This extension adds a new service that is required for proper serialization. For instance, instead of registering your deployment step like this:

```csharp
services.AddTransient<IDeploymentSource, AdminMenuDeploymentSource>();
services.AddSingleton<IDeploymentStepFactory>(new DeploymentStepFactory<AdminMenuDeploymentStep>());
services.AddScoped<IDisplayDriver<DeploymentStep>, AdminMenuDeploymentStepDriver>();
```

change it to the following:

```csharp
services.AddDeployment<AdminMenuDeploymentSource, AdminMenuDeploymentStep, AdminMenuDeploymentStepDriver>();
```

  - If you are using a custom AdminMenu node, change how you register it by using the new `AddAdminNode<>` extension. This extension adds a new service that is required for proper serialization. For instance, instead of registering your custom admin menu nodep like this:

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IAdminNodeProviderFactory>(new AdminNodeProviderFactory<PlaceholderAdminNode>());
services.AddScoped<IAdminNodeNavigationBuilder, PlaceholderAdminNodeNavigationBuilder>();
services.AddScoped<IDisplayDriver<MenuItem>, PlaceholderAdminNodeDriver>();
```

change it to the following:

```csharp
services.AddAdminNode<PlaceholderAdminNode, PlaceholderAdminNodeNavigationBuilder, PlaceholderAdminNodeDriver>();
```

  - Any serializable object that contains a polymorphic property (a base type that can contain sub-classes instances) needs to register all possible sub-classes this way:

```csharp
services.AddJsonDerivedTypeInfo<UrlCondition, Condition>();
```

Alternatively, you can simplify your code by using the newly added extensions to register custom conditions. For example,

```csharp
services.AddRule<HomepageCondition, HomepageConditionEvaluator, HomepageConditionDisplayDriver>();
```

 - Any type introduced in custom modules inheriting from `MenuItem`, `AdminNode`, `Condition`, `ConditionOperator`, `Query`, `SitemapType` will have to register the class using the `services.AddJsonDerivedTypeInfo<>` method. For example,

```csharp
services.AddJsonDerivedTypeInfo<SqlQuery, Query>();
```

 - The extension `PopulateSettings<T>(model)` was removed from `PartFieldDefinition`. If you are using this method in your code, you'll have to get the settings using the `Settings` object directly. For instance, if you have this code,

 ```csharp
 public override IDisplayResult Edit(ContentPartFieldDefinition partFieldDefinition)
 {
    return Initialize<NumericFieldSettings>("NumericFieldSettings_Edit", model => partFieldDefinition.PopulateSettings(model));
 }
 ```

 You'll change it to the following:

 ```csharp
  public override IDisplayResult Edit(ContentPartFieldDefinition partFieldDefinition)
 {
    return Initialize<NumericFieldSettings>("NumericFieldSettings_Edit", model => 
    {
        var settings = partFieldDefinition.Settings.ToObject<NumericFieldSettings>();
        model.Hint = settings.Hint;
        // ...
    });
 }
 ```

### Queries

Previously, any query type had to inherit from `Query` and required its own distinct type (e.g., `SqlQuery`, `LuceneQuery`, `ElasticQuery`). However, with [pull request #16402](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/16402), creating a custom type for each query type is no longer necessary. This update involved changes to the `IQueryManager` and `IQuerySource` interfaces, as well as the `Query` class. Additionally, a new project, `OrchardCore.Queries.Core`, was introduced.

A migration process has been implemented to transition existing queries into the new structure, ensuring no impact on existing tenants. 

#### Key Changes

- **Modification of Interfaces and Classes**: Updates were made to the `IQueryManager`, `IQuerySource` interface, and `Query` class to accommodate the new structure.
- **Addition of `OrchardCore.Queries.Core`**: This new project supports the updated query handling mechanism.

#### Implementing `IQuerySource`

We now request implementations of `IQuerySource` using keyed services. Below is an example of how to register new implementations:

```csharp
services.AddQuerySource<SqlQuerySource>(SqlQuerySource.SourceName);
```

This approach allows for more flexible and modular query handling in OrchardCore.

#### Handlers

We now have handlers for dealing with queries. To manipulate a query using a handler, implement the `IQueryHandler` interface. This provides a structured way to extend and customize the behavior of queries within the framework.

### Twitter Module

The `Twitter` module has been rebranded to `X`.

If you were using the `OrchardCore_Twitter` configuration key to configure the module, please update the configuration key to `OrchardCore_X`. The `OrchardCore_Twitter` key continues to work but will be deprecated in a future release.

### Users Module

- The `Login.cshtml` has undergone a significant revamp. The previous `AfterLogin` zone, which allowed filters for injecting shapes, has been replaced. Now, you can inject shapes using drivers by implementing `IDisplayDriver<LoginForm>`. For example, the 'Forgot Password?' link is injected using the following driver:

```csharp
public class ForgotPasswordLoginFormDisplayDriver : DisplayDriver<LoginForm>
{
    private readonly ISiteService _siteService;

    public ForgotPasswordLoginFormDisplayDriver(ISiteService siteService)
    {
        _siteService = siteService;
    }

    public override async Task<IDisplayResult> EditAsync(LoginForm model, BuildEditorContext context)
    {
        var settings = await _siteService.GetSettingsAsync<ResetPasswordSettings>();

        if (!settings.AllowResetPassword)
        {
            return null;
        }

        return View("LoginFormForgotPassword_Edit", model).Location("Links:5");
    }
}
```

- The `ForgotPassword.cshtml` has undergone a significant revamp. The previous `AfterForgotPassword` zone, which allowed filters for injecting shapes, has been replaced. Now, you can inject shapes using drivers by implementing `IDisplayDriver<ForgotPasswordForm>`. For example, the ReCaptcha shape is injected using the following driver:

```csharp
public class ReCaptchaForgotPasswordFormDisplayDriver : DisplayDriver<ForgotPasswordForm>
{
    private readonly ISiteService _siteService;

    public ReCaptchaForgotPasswordFormDisplayDriver(ISiteService siteService)
    {
        _siteService = siteService;
    }

    public override async Task<IDisplayResult> EditAsync(ForgotPasswordForm model, BuildEditorContext context)
    {
        var settings = await _siteService.GetSettingsAsync<ReCaptchaSettings>();

        if (!settings.IsValid())
        {
            return null;
        }

        return View("FormReCaptcha_Edit", model).Location("Content:after");
    }
}
```

- The `ResetPassword.cshtml` has undergone a significant revamp. The previous `AfterResetPassword` zone, which allowed filters for injecting shapes, has been replaced. Now, you can inject shapes using drivers by implementing `IDisplayDriver<ResetPasswordForm>`. For example, the ReCaptcha shape is injected using the following driver:

```csharp
public class ReCaptchaResetPasswordFormDisplayDriver : DisplayDriver<ResetPasswordForm>
{
    private readonly ISiteService _siteService;

    public ReCaptchaResetPasswordFormDisplayDriver(ISiteService siteService)
    {
        _siteService = siteService;
    }

    public override async Task<IDisplayResult> EditAsync(ResetPasswordForm model, BuildEditorContext context)
    {
        var settings = await _siteService.GetSettingsAsync<ReCaptchaSettings>();

        if (!settings.IsValid())
        {
            return null;
        }

        return View("FormReCaptcha_Edit", model).Location("Content:after");
    }
}
```

Previously, users were only able to reset their password through email when the "Reset Password" feature was enabled. However, we've enhanced this functionality to offer users the flexibility of resetting their password using either their email or username. Consequently, the `Email` property on both the `ForgotPasswordViewModel` and `ResetPasswordViewModel` have been deprecated and should be replaced with the new `UsernameOrEmail` property for password resets.

- The `Register.cshtml` has undergone a significant revamp. The previous `AfterRegister` zone, which allowed filters for injecting shapes, has been replaced. Now, you can inject shapes using drivers by implementing `IDisplayDriver<RegisterUserForm>`. For example, the ReCaptcha shape is injected using the following driver:

```csharp
public class RegisterUserFormDisplayDriver : DisplayDriver<RegisterUserForm>
{
    private readonly ISiteService _siteService;

    public RegisterUserFormDisplayDriver(ISiteService siteService)
    {
        _siteService = siteService;
    }

    public override async Task<IDisplayResult> EditAsync(RegisterUserForm model, BuildEditorContext context)
    {
        var settings = await _siteService.GetSettingsAsync<ReCaptchaSettings>();

        if (!settings.IsValid())
        {
            return null;
        }

        return View("FormReCaptcha_Edit", model).Location("Content:after");
    }
}
```

- Two-factor authentication (2FA) is now available for all users. Previously, only users with permission to access the admin area could set up their own 2FA methods, although all users could still use 2FA if it was set up by an admin. To enable this change, the method `IsRequiredAsync()` in both the `ITwoFactorAuthenticationHandlerCoordinator` and `ITwoFactorAuthenticationHandler` interfaces has been updated to `IsRequiredAsync(IUser user)`.

### Notifications Module

The endpoint for marking notifications as read has been updated. Previously the route was `/api/notifications/read`, and now it is `/Notifications/MarkAsRead`. This change will only affect you if you have overridden the `UserNotificationNavbar` view.

### Contents

The `IContentManager` interface was modified. The method `Task<IEnumerable<ContentItem>> GetAsync(IEnumerable<string> contentItemIds, bool latest = false)` was removed. Instead use the method that accepts `VersionOptions` by providing either `VersionOptions.Latest` or `VersionOptions.Published` will be used by default.

Additionally, the `GetContentItemByHandleAsync(string handle, bool latest = false)` and `GetContentItemByIdAsync(string contentItemId, bool latest = false)` were removed from `IOrchardHelper`. Instead use the method that accepts `VersionOptions` by providing either `VersionOptions.Latest` or `VersionOptions.Published` will be used by default.

Lastly, we dropped support for AllVersions option in `VersionOptions`. Instead, you can use the new `GetAllVersionsAsync(string contentItemId)` method on `IContentManager`.

### Media Indexing

Previously, `.pdf` files were automatically indexed in the search providers (Elasticsearch, Lucene or Azure AI Search). Now, if you want to continue to index `.PDF` file you'll need to enable the `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.Pdf` feature.

Additionally, if you need to enable indexing for text file with `.txt`, `.md` extensions, you will need the `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.Text` feature.

If you need to enable indexing for other extensions like (`.docx`, or `.pptx`), you will need the `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.OpenXML` feature.

### SMS Module

In the past, we utilized the injection of `ISmsProvider` for sending SMS messages. However, in this release, it is now necessary to inject `ISmsService` instead.

Additionally, `Twilio` provider is no longer enabled by default. If you want to use Twilio SMS provider, you must enable the provider by visiting the email settings `Configuration` > `Settings` > `Email` and see the `Twilio` tab.

### Display Management

In this release, the signatures of the `UpdateAsync()` method within the `SectionDisplayDriver` base class have undergone modifications. Previously, these signatures accepted the `BuildEditorContext` parameter. However, with this update, all signatures now require the `UpdateEditorContext` instead. This alteration necessitates that every driver inheriting from this class adjusts their contexts accordingly.

Here are the updated signatures:

1. **From:**
   `Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(TModel model, BuildEditorContext context)`
   **To:**
   `Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(TModel model, UpdateEditorContext context)`

2. **From:**
   `Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(TModel model, TSection section, BuildEditorContext context)`
   **To:**
   `Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(TModel model, TSection section, UpdateEditorContext context)`

3. **From:**
   `Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(TSection section, BuildEditorContext context)`
   **To:**
   `Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(TSection section, UpdateEditorContext context)`. This method is now obsolete.

These adjustments ensure compatibility and adherence to the latest conventions within the `DisplayDriver` class.

Additionally, we've enhanced display performance by streamlining the display drivers. To achieve this, the following methods have been marked as obsolete:

- `IDisplayResult Display(TModel model)`
- `IDisplayResult Edit(TModel model)`

and removed the following methods:

- `Task<IDisplayResult> DisplayAsync(TModel model, IUpdateModel updater)`
- `IDisplayResult Display(TModel model, IUpdateModel updater)`
- `Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(TModel model, IUpdateModel updater)`
- `Task<IDisplayResult> EditAsync(TModel model, IUpdateModel updater)`
- `IDisplayResult Edit(TModel model, IUpdateModel updater)`

At the same time, we've introduced the following static methods in the `DisplayDriverBase`:

- `Task<IDisplayResult> CombineAsync(params IDisplayResult[] results)`
- `Task<IDisplayResult> CombineAsync(IEnumerable<IDisplayResult> results)`

Similar refactoring was done to `SectionDisplayDriver` class. The following methods have been marked as obsolete:

- `Display(TSection section, BuildDisplayContext context)`
- `Display(TSection section)`
- `Edit(TSection section, BuildEditorContext context)`
- `UpdateAsync(TSection section, UpdateEditorContext context)`
- `UpdateAsync(TSection section, IUpdateModel updater, string groupId)`

and removed the following methods:

- `UpdateAsync(TModel model, TSection section, IUpdateModel updater, UpdateEditorContext context)`
- `UpdateAsync(TSection section, IUpdateModel updater, UpdateEditorContext context)`
- `UpdateAsync(TSection section, IUpdateModel updater, string groupId)`
- `UpdateAsync(TSection section, UpdateEditorContext context)`
- `EditAsync(TSection section, BuildEditorContext context)`
- `DisplayAsync(TSection section, BuildDisplayContext context)`

!!! note
    To enhance your project's performance, address any warnings generated by the use of these obsolete methods. Please note that these methods will be removed in the next major release.

A new `SiteDisplayDriver` base class was introduced to simplify the process of adding a UI settings.
 

 !!! note
    With the new `SiteDisplayDriver` base class for custom settings, you no longer need explicit checks like `context.GroupId.Equals(GroupId, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)` as the base class handles this check for you.

Similarly, the `ContentPartDisplayDriver` base class have undergone modifications. The following methods were marked obsolete:

- `IDisplayResult Display(TPart part)`
- `IDisplayResult Edit(TPart part)`
- `Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(TPart part, IUpdateModel updater)`

At the same time, the following method was removed:

- `Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(TPart part, IUpdateModel updater)`

Moreover, the `ContentFieldDisplayDriver` base class have undergone modifications. The following methods were marked obsolete:

- `UpdateAsync(TField field, IUpdateModel updater, UpdateFieldEditorContext context)`
- `Update(TField field, IUpdateModel updater, UpdateFieldEditorContext context)`

At the same time, the following method was added:

- `UpdateAsync(TField field, UpdateFieldEditorContext context)`

### GraphQL Module

The GraphQL schema may change because fields are now always added to the correct part. Previously, additional fields may have been added to the parent content item type directly. 

You may have to adjust your GraphQL queries in that case.

Additionally, the `GetAliases` method in the `IIndexAliasProvider` interface is now asynchronous and has been renamed to `GetAliasesAsync`. Implementations of this interface should be modified by updating the method signature and ensure they handle asynchronous operations correctly.

#### Media fields

The schema for media fields has been updated. Instead of separate lists for `fileNames`, `urls`, `paths`, and `mediatexts`, these fields are now grouped under a single `files` type to simplify data binding on the front end.

Please update your existing queries as shown in the following example:

Before:

```graphql
{
  article {
    contentItemId
    image {
      mediatexts(first: 10)
      urls(first: 10)
    }
  }
}
```

After:

```graphql
{
  article {
    contentItemId
    image {
      files(first: 10) {
        mediaText
        url
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A compatibility switch has been introduced to allow continued use of the old `fileNames`, `urls`, `paths`, and `mediatexts` fields. To restore the legacy fields, add the following AppContext switch to your startup class:

```csharp
AppContext.SetSwitch("OrchardCore.Media.EnableLegacyMediaFieldGraphQLFields", true);
```

### Resource Management

Previously the `<resources type="..." />` Razor tag helper and the `{% resources type: "..." %}` Liquid tag were only capable of handling a hard-coded set of resource definition types (`script`, `stylesheet`, etc). Now both can be extended with `IResourcesTagHelperProcessor` to run custom rendering logic. To make this possible, the `OrchardCore.ResourceManagement.TagHelpers.ResourceType` and `OrchardCore.Resources.Liquid.ResourcesTag.ResourceType` enums have been replaced with a common `OrchardCore.ResourceManagement.ResourceTagType`. It was renamed to avoid confusion with `ResourceDefinition.Type`. This change does not affect the uses of the Razor tag helper or the Liquid tag in templates of user projects, but it affects published releases such as NuGet packages. Any themes and modules that contain `<resources type="..." />` in a Razor file (e.g. _Layout.cshtml_) must be re-released to generate the updated `.cshtml.cs` files, because the old pre-compiled templates would throw `MissingMethodException`.

## Change Logs

### Azure AI Search Module

Introducing a new "Azure AI Search" module, designed to empower you in the administration of Azure AI Search indices. When enabled with the "Search" module, it facilitates frontend full-text search capabilities through Azure AI Search. For more info read the [Azure AI Search](../reference/modules/AzureAISearch/README.md) docs.

### New ImageSharp Image Caches for Azure Blob and AWS S3 Storage

The Microsoft Azure Media and Amazon S3 Media modules have new features for replacing the default `PhysicalFileSystemCache` of ImageSharp that stores resized images in the local `App_Data` folder. Instead, you can now use Azure Blob Storage with the Azure Media ImageSharp Image Cache feature (that utilizes [`AzureBlobStorageImageCache`](https://docs.sixlabors.com/articles/imagesharp.web/imagecaches.html#azureblobstorageimagecache)), and AWS S3 with the Amazon Media ImageSharp Image Cache feature (that utilizes [`AWSS3StorageCache`](https://docs.sixlabors.com/articles/imagesharp.web/imagecaches.html#awss3storagecache)). Depending on your use case, this can provide various advantages. Check out [the Azure Media](../reference/modules/Media.Azure/README.md) and [the Amazon S3 Media](../reference/modules/Media.AmazonS3/README.md) docs for details.

### Deployment Module

#### New Extensions

Added new extensions to make registering custom deployment step easier:

- `services.AddDeployment<TSource, TStep>()`.
- `services.AddDeployment<TSource, TStep, TDisplayDriver>()`.
- `services.AddDeploymentWithoutSource<TStep, TDisplayDriver>()`.

#### Recipe Executions

Before this release, implementations of `IRecipeStepHandler` or `IRecipeEventHandler` would throw exceptions to report errors if something failed to import. However, this is no longer the recommended approach for error reporting.

Now, to handle errors, we have introduced a new property named `Errors` in the `RecipeExecutionContext`. This property allows you to log errors instead of throwing exceptions. These errors should be localized and must not contain any sensitive data, as they are visible to the end user. Exceptions are still used for logging additional information, but these are not shown to the end user.

Additionally, if an error occurs, a new custom exception, RecipeExecutionException, is thrown. For more info visit the [related pull-request](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/16148/).

### Workflows Module

 The method `Task TriggerEventAsync(string name, IDictionary<string, object> input = null, string correlationId = null, bool isExclusive = false, bool isAlwaysCorrelated = false)` 
 was changed to return `Task<IEnumerable<WorkflowExecutionContext>>` instead.
 
#### CorrelationId

**Breaking change:**
`CreateContentTask`, `RetrieveContentTask`, and `UpdateContentTask`, in previous versions, the workflow's CorrelationId was updated each time with the ContentItemId of the current content item;
Now, the CorrelationId value will only be updated if the current workflow's CorrelationId is empty.

Also added a workflow-scoped script function `setCorrelationId(id:string): void`, that you can use to update the workflow's CorrelationId.


### GraphQL Module

When identifying content types for GraphQL exposure, we identify those without a stereotype to provide you with control over the behavior of stereotyped content types. A new option, `DiscoverableSterotypes`, has been introduced in `GraphQLContentOptions`. This allows you to specify stereotypes that should be discoverable by default.

For instance, if you have several content types stereotyped as `ExampleStereotype`, you can make them discoverable by incorporating the following code into the startup class:

```csharp
services.Configure<GraphQLContentOptions>(options =>
{
    options.DiscoverableSterotypes.Add("ExampleStereotype");
});
```

The GraphQL module now allows for filtering content fields, making it easier to query specific content fields using GraphQL. This enhancement relies on having the `OrchardCore.ContentFields.Indexing.SQL` module enabled.

To filter content items based on a specific content field, you can use a query like this:

```graphql
product(where: {price: {amount_gt: 10}}) {
    contentItemId
    displayText
    price {
        amount
    }
}
```

### Email Module

The `OrchardCore.Email` module has undergone a refactoring process with no breaking changes. However, there are compile-time warnings that are recommended to be addressed. Here is a summary of the changes:

 - Previously, we used the injection of `ISmtpService` for sending email messages. In this release, it is now necessary to inject `IEmailService` instead.
 - The `SMTP` related services are now part of a new module named `OrchardCore.Email.Smtp`. To use the SMTP provider for sending emails, enable the `OrchardCore.Email.Smtp` feature.
 - If you were using the `OrchardCore_Email` configuration key to set up the SMTP provider for all tenants, please update the configuration key to `OrchardCore_Email_Smtp`. The `OrchardCore_Email` key continues to work but will be deprecated in a future release.
 - A new email provider was added to allow you to send email using Azure Communication Services Email. Click [here](../reference/modules/Email.Azure/README.md) to read more about the ACS module.
 
### Menu

`Menus` and `AdminMenus` now support specifying the target property.

### Admin Menu

The admin menu has undergone performance enhancements, and new helpers have been added. When incorporating `INavigationProvider` in your project, you can now utilize `NavigationHelper.IsAdminMenu(name)` instead of the previous approach using `string.Equals(name, "admin", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)`. Moreover, when passing route values to an action, it is advised to store them in a constant variable. An illustrative example is provided below.

```csharp
public sealed class AdminMenu : INavigationProvider
{
    private static readonly RouteValueDictionary _routeValues = new()
    {
        { "area", "OrchardCore.Settings" },
        { "groupId", AdminSiteSettingsDisplayDriver.GroupId },
    };

    internal readonly IStringLocalizer S;

    public AdminMenu(IStringLocalizer<AdminMenu> stringLocalizer)
    {
        S = stringLocalizer;
    }

    public Task BuildNavigationAsync(string name, NavigationBuilder builder)
    {
        if (!NavigationHelper.IsAdminMenu(name))
        {
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        builder
            .Add(S["Configuration"], configuration => configuration
                .Add(S["Settings"], settings => settings
                    .Add(S["Admin"], S["Admin"].PrefixPosition(), admin => admin
                        .AddClass("admin")
                        .Id("admin")
                        .Action("Index", "Admin", _routeValues)
                        .Permission(PermissionsAdminSettings.ManageAdminSettings)
                        .LocalNav()
                    )
                )
            );

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

### Admin Routes

The `[Admin]` attribute now has optional parameters for a custom route template and route name. It works just like the `[Route(template, name)]` attribute, except it prepends the configured admin prefix. You can apply it to the controller or the action; if both are specified then the action's template takes precedence. The route name can contain `{area}`, `{controller}`, and `{action}`, which are substituted during mapping so the names can be unique for each action. This means you don't have to define these admin routes in your module's `Startup` class anymore, but that option is still available and supported. Take a look at this example:

```csharp
[Admin("Person/{action}/{id?}", "Person{action}")]
public sealed class PersonController : Controller
{
    [Admin("Person", "Person")]
    public IActionResult Index() { ... }

    public IActionResult Create() { ... }

    public IActionResult Edit(string id) { ... }
}
```

In this example, (if the admin prefix remains the default "Admin") you can reach the Index action at `~/Admin/Person` (or by the route name `Person`), because its own action-level attribute took precedence. You can reach Create at `~/Admin/Person/Create` (route name `PersonCreate`) and Edit for the person whose identifier string is "john-doe" at `~/Admin/Person/john-doe` (route name `PersonEdit`).

### Users Module

Added a new User Localization feature that allows to be able to configure the culture per user from the admin UI.

### Navbar

Added a new `Navbar()` function to Liquid to allow building the `Navbar` shape using Liquid. Here are the steps needed to add the `Navbar` shape into your custom Liquid shape:

1. Construct the shape at the beginning of the `layout.liquid` file to enable navbar items to potentially contribute to the resources output as necessary.

```
{% assign navbar = Navbar() | shape_render %}
```
2. Subsequently in the `layout.liquid` file, invoke the shape at the location where you want to display it.

```
{{ navbar }}
```

### Notifications Module

The`INotificationMessage` interface was updated to includes the addition of a `Subject` field, which facilitates the rendering of notification titles. Moreover, the existing `Summary` field has been transitioned to HTML format. This adjustment enables the rendering of HTML notifications in both the navigation bar and the notification center. Consequently, HTML notifications can now be created, affording functionalities such as clickable notifications.

Furthermore, the introduction of the `NotificationOptions` provides configuration capabilities for the notifications module. This structure comprises the following attributes:

- `TotalUnreadNotifications`: This property determines the maximum number of unread notifications displayed in the navigation bar, with a default setting of 10.
- `DisableNotificationHtmlBodySanitizer`: By default, the `HtmlBody` of notifications generated from workflows undergoes a sanitization process. However, this property grants the option to bypass this sanitization process.

### Secure media files

Introduces a new "Secure Media" feature for additional control over who can access media files. For more info read the [Secure Media](../reference/modules/Media/README.md#secure-media) docs.

### Users Module

Enhanced functionality has been implemented, giving developers the ability to control the expiration time of different tokens, such as those for password reset, email confirmation, and email change, which are sent through the email service. Below, you'll find a comprehensive list of configurable options along with their default values: 
 
 | Class Name | Default Expiration Value |
 | ---------- | ------------------------ |
 | `ChangeEmailTokenProviderOptions` | The token is valid by default for **15 minutes**. |
 | `EmailConfirmationTokenProviderOptions` | The token is valid by default for **48 hours**. |
 | `PasswordResetTokenProviderOptions` | The token is valid by default for **15 minutes**. |

 You may change the default values of these options by using the `services.Configure<>` method. For instance, to change the `EmailConfirmationTokenProviderOptions` you can add the following code to your project

 ```csharp
 services.Configure<EmailConfirmationTokenProviderOptions>(options => options.TokenLifespan = TimeSpan.FromDays(7));
 ```

### Reloading Tenants

The recent addition in the [Pull Request](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/15875) introduces the `IShellReleaseManager`, enabling you to initiate a shell release at the request's conclusion via the `RequestRelease()` method. This action is accessible from any service within the application. However, there's no assurance of immediate fulfillment since another service may utilize the same service and suspend the release request later. Should you need to suspend the request to release the shell, you can utilize the `SuspendReleaseRequest()` method to suspend the tenant release request and the tenant will not be released.

#### Reloading Tenants Display Drivers

When implementing a site settings display driver, you have the option to reload the shell (restart the tenant). If you choose to do so, manually releasing the shell context using `await _shellHost.ReleaseShellContextAsync(_shellSettings)` is unnecessary. Instead, you should use the new `IShellReleaseManager.RequestRelease()`. This ensures that the shell stays intact until all settings are validated. For instance, in `ReverseProxySettingsDisplayDriver`, the code was modified from this:

```csharp
public class ReverseProxySettingsDisplayDriver : SiteDisplayDriver<ReverseProxySettings>
{
    //
    // For  example simplicity, other methods are not visible.
    //

    public override async Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(ISite site, ReverseProxySettings settings, UpdateEditorContext context)
    {
        var user = _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext?.User;

        if (!await _authorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(user, Permissions.ManageReverseProxySettings))
        {
            return null;
        }

        //
        // For  example simplicity, other logic are not visible.
        //

        // If the settings are valid, release the current tenant.
        if (context.Updater.ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            await _shellHost.ReleaseShellContextAsync(_shellSettings);
        }

        return await EditAsync(site, settings, context);
    }
}
```

To this:

```csharp
public class ReverseProxySettingsDisplayDriver : SiteDisplayDriver<ReverseProxySettings>
{
    private readonly IShellReleaseManager _shellReleaseManager;
    private readonly IHttpContextAccessor _httpContextAccessor;
    private readonly IAuthorizationService _authorizationService;

    public ReverseProxySettingsDisplayDriver(
        // (1) Inject the new service.
        IShellReleaseManager shellReleaseManager
        IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor,
        IAuthorizationService authorizationService)
    {
        _shellReleaseManager = shellReleaseManager;
        _httpContextAccessor = httpContextAccessor;
        _authorizationService = authorizationService;
    }

    //
    // For  example simplicity, other methods are not visible.
    //

    public override async Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(ISite site, ReverseProxySettings settings, UpdateEditorContext context)
    {
        var user = _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext?.User;

        if (!await _authorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(user, Permissions.ManageReverseProxySettings))
        {
            return null;
        }

        //
        // For  example simplicity, other logic are not visible.
        //

        // (2) Request a release at the end of the request.
        _shellReleaseManager.RequestRelease();

        return await EditAsync(site, settings, context);
    }
}
```

### Infrastructure

Prior to this release, if you had a module with multiple features, you had to use the `[Feature("your feature id")]` attribute to assign `IShapeTableProvider`, `IDataMigration`, and `IPermissionProvider` to a specific feature of the module that had a feature ID other than the module ID. With [pull-request 15793](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/15793), this is no longer needed. However, `[Feature("...")]` is still required for the `Startup` class and controllers when you want the controller action to be available only when a specific feature is enabled.

### Site Settings

 - New extension methods named `GetSettingsAsync<T>()` and `GetSettingsAsync<T>("")` were added to the `ISiteService` interface. These methods allow you to retrieve specific settings with a single line of code. For example, to get the `LoginSettings`, you can now use:

```csharp
await _siteService.GetSettingsAsync<LoginSettings>();
```

Previously, achieving the same result required more code:

```csharp
(await _siteService.GetSiteSettingsAsync()).As<LoginSettings>();
```

 - A new extension method named `GetCustomSettingsAsync()` was added to the `ISiteService` interface. This method allows you to retrieve [custom settings](../reference/modules/CustomSettings/README.md). For example, to get custom settings of type 'BlogSettings', you can now use:

```csharp
ContentItem blogSettings = await _siteService.GetCustomSettingsAsync("BlogSettings");
```

Previously, achieving the same result required more code:

```csharp
var siteSettings = await _siteService.GetSiteSettingsAsync();
var blogSettings = siteSettings.As<ContentItem>("BlogSettings");
```

### Content Fields

Before this release, the `MarkdownField` used a single-line input field by default (named the Standard editor) and offered two different editors: Multi-line with a simple `textarea` and WYSIWYG with a rich editor. Now, by default, it uses a `textarea` as the Standard editor, and the separate Multi-line option has been removed.

You have nothing to do, fields configured with the Standard or Multi-line editors previously will both continue to work. Note though, that their editors will now be a `textarea`.

### Liquid

The `Culture` context variable got the new properties for a fuller Liquid culture support: `DisplayName`, `NativeName`, and `TwoLetterISOLanguageName`. These are the same as their .NET counterparts.

A new filter named `supported_cultures` was added to allow you to get a list of supported cultures. Here is an example of how to print the names of supported cultures using a list:

```
{% assign cultures = Culture | supported_cultures %}

<ul>
{% for culture in cultures %}
    <li>{{ culture.Name }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
```

### Adding properties with additional tag helpers

The new `<add-property>` tag helper can be placed inside the `<shape>` tag helpers to add properties to the shape. This is similar to `prop-*` attributes, but you can also include Razor code as the `IHtmlContent` property value, which was impossible before. See more details [here](../reference/core/Placement/README.md#adding-properties-with-additional-tag-helpers).

### Sealing Types

Many type commonly used by modules can be `sealed`, which improves runtime performance. While it's not mandatory, we recommend that you consider applying this improvement to your own extensions as well. We've implemented this enhancement in the following pull-requests:

- [16253](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/16253)
- [16238](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/16238) 
- [16464](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/16464)
- [16535](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/16535)
- [16536](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/16536)
- [16576](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/16576)

!!! note
    Do not seal classes that are used to create shapes like view-models. Sealing these classes can break your code at runtime, as these classes need to be unsealed to allow for proxy creation.

### Workflow Trimming

The Workflows module now has a `Trimming` feature to automatically clean up old workflow instances. See [the corresponding documentation](../reference/modules/Workflows/README.md#trimming) for details.

### Obsoleting `TrimEnd`

The methods `public static string TrimEnd(this string value, string trim = "")` from `OrchardCore.Mvc.Utilities` and `OrchardCore.ContentManagement.Utilities` are being obsoleted and replaced by 
`OrchardCore.ContentManagement.Utilities.TrimEndString(this string value, string suffix)`. This was done to prepare the code base for the next .NET 9.0 release which has a conflicting method 
with a different behavior.
