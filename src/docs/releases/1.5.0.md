# Orchard Core 1.5.0

Release date: October 2022

This release contains security vulnerability fixes. It is recommended you update your existing Orchard Core deployments with this version.

## Breaking Changes

* The `OrchardCore_Media_AmazonS3` config section was changed: `RegionEndpoint` was renamed to `Region` and extracted from `Credentials` section to the root section of `OrchardCore_Media_AmazonS3`, `AccessKeyId` was renamed to `AccessKey`, `ProfileName` was renamed to `Profile`. See [this pull request](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/11871) for details.

* Lucene breaking changes. See [this pull request](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/11052) for details.

`ISearchQueryService` moved to `OrchardCore.Search.Lucene.Abstractions` module as `ILuceneSearchQueryService`. The `OrchardCore.Search` module now takes into consideration multiple search provider implementations.

## Lucene Migration

Manual migration to get back Lucene Indices Settings, Deployment plans, and Queries. (Reference only)

```sql
  UPDATE Document SET Content = REPLACE(content, '\"$type\":\"OrchardCore.Lucene.Deployment.LuceneIndexDeploymentStep, OrchardCore.Lucene\"', '\"$type\":\"OrchardCore.Search.Lucene.Deployment.LuceneIndexDeploymentStep, OrchardCore.Search.Lucene\"')
  WHERE [Type] = 'OrchardCore.Deployment.DeploymentPlan, OrchardCore.Deployment.Abstractions'

  UPDATE Document SET Content = REPLACE(content, '\"$type\":\"OrchardCore.Lucene.Deployment.LuceneSettingsDeploymentStep, OrchardCore.Lucene\"', '\"$type\":\"OrchardCore.Search.Lucene.Deployment.LuceneSettingsDeploymentStep, OrchardCore.Search.Lucene\"')
  WHERE [Type] = 'OrchardCore.Deployment.DeploymentPlan, OrchardCore.Deployment.Abstractions'

  UPDATE Document SET Content = REPLACE(content, '\"$type\":\"OrchardCore.Lucene.Deployment.LuceneIndexResetDeploymentStep, OrchardCore.Lucene\"', '\"$type\":\"OrchardCore.Search.Lucene.Deployment.LuceneIndexResetDeploymentStep, OrchardCore.Search.Lucene\"')
  WHERE [Type] = 'OrchardCore.Deployment.DeploymentPlan, OrchardCore.Deployment.Abstractions'

  UPDATE Document SET Content = REPLACE(content, '\"$type\":\"OrchardCore.Lucene.Deployment.LuceneIndexRebuildDeploymentStep, OrchardCore.Lucene\"', '\"$type\":\"OrchardCore.Search.Lucene.Deployment.LuceneIndexRebuildDeploymentStep, OrchardCore.Search.Lucene\"')
  WHERE [Type] = 'OrchardCore.Deployment.DeploymentPlan, OrchardCore.Deployment.Abstractions'

  UPDATE Document SET Content = REPLACE(content, '"$type":"OrchardCore.Lucene.LuceneQuery, OrchardCore.Lucene"', '"$type":"OrchardCore.Search.Lucene.LuceneQuery, OrchardCore.Search.Lucene"')
  WHERE  [Type] = 'OrchardCore.Queries.Services.QueriesDocument, OrchardCore.Queries'

  UPDATE Document SET [Type] = 'OrchardCore.Search.Lucene.Model.LuceneIndexSettingsDocument, OrchardCore.Search.Lucene'
  WHERE [Type] = 'OrchardCore.Lucene.Model.LuceneIndexSettingsDocument, OrchardCore.Lucene'
```

## Lucene Breaking Changes

### Module rename

The module was renamed from `OrchardCore.Lucene` to `OrchardCore.Search.Lucene`. Update your recipe files and dependency declarations in extension manifests.

### IndexingConstants changes : 

| Constant | Before | after |
|----------|--------|-------|
| DisplayTextKey | Content.ContentItem.DisplayText | Content.ContentItem.DisplayText.keyword |
| ContainedPartKey + IdsKey (new) | Content.ContentItem.ContainedPart.ListContentItemId | Content.ContentItem.ContainedPart.Ids |

### Taxonomies module indexing

You can now access the term ids of a taxonomy field by using "{ContentTypeName}.{FieldName}.Ids".

### Queries migration

Elasticsearch maps automatically the data which means that Text fields will always be `Tokenized`. You can now access the `Stored` value of that Text field by using `.keyword` as a suffix to your field name. This means that you can now use a `TermQuery` on that `.keyword` field and a `MatchQuery` on the basic field name. See [Elasticsearch vs Lucene](../reference/modules/Elasticsearch/README.md#elasticsearch-vs-lucene)

### Permissions

ManageIndexes will be now ManageLuceneIndexes

### Lucene indexation

| Before | After | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Indexed | Indexed | Indexed meant "Keyword" in Lucene so we migrated these to "Keyword" in the content index settings.
| Analyzed | Keyword | The Analyzed option is removed. Everything that was set as analyzed doesn't need migration because it is now the default.  |
| Stored | Stored | Nothing to do. Should work as before |

## YesSQL breaking changes

YesSql is now using the new SQL client which encrypts the connection by default.

If the SQL Server does not have a trusted SSL certificate and you would and want to continue using encrypted communicated using the untrusted server, add `TrustServerCertificate=True` to the connection string.

If you do not want to encrypt the communication at all, you can use `Encrypt=false`.
