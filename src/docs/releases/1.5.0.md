## Lucene Migration

Manual migration to get back Lucene Indices Settings and Queries. (Reference only)

```sql
  UPDATE Document SET Content = REPLACE(content, '"$type":"OrchardCore.Lucene.LuceneQuery, OrchardCore.Lucene"', '"$type":"OrchardCore.Search.Lucene.LuceneQuery, OrchardCore.Search.Lucene"')
  WHERE  [Type] = 'OrchardCore.Queries.Services.QueriesDocument, OrchardCore.Queries'

  UPDATE Document SET [Type] = 'OrchardCore.Search.Lucene.Model.LuceneIndexSettingsDocument, OrchardCore.Search.Lucene'
  WHERE [Type] = 'OrchardCore.Lucene.Model.LuceneIndexSettingsDocument, OrchardCore.Lucene'
```

## Lucene Breaking Changes

### IndexingConstants changes : 

| Constant | Before | after |
|----------|--------|-------|
| DisplayTextKey | Content.ContentItem.DisplayText | Content.ContentItem.DisplayText.keyword |
| ContainedPartKey + IdsKey (new) | Content.ContentItem.ContainedPart.ListContentItemId | Content.ContentItem.ContainedPart.Ids |
### Taxonomies module indexing

You can now access the term ids of a taxonomy field by using "{ContentTypeName}.{FieldName}.Ids".

### Queries migration

Elasticsearch maps automatically the data which means that Text fields will always be `Tokenized`. You can now access the `Stored` value of that Text field by using `.keyword` as a suffix to your field name. This means that you can now use a `TermQuery` on that `.keyword` field and a `MatchQuery` on the basic field name. See [Elasticsearch vs Lucene](../reference/modules/Elasticsearch/README.md#elasticsearch-vs-lucene)

### Permissions

ManageIndexes will be now ManageLuceneIndexes

### Lucene indexation

| Before | After | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Indexed | Indexed | Indexed meant "Keyword" in Lucene so we migrated these to "Keyword" in the content index settings.
| Analyzed | Keyword | The Analyzed option is removed. Everything that was set as analyzed doesn't need migration because it is now the default.  |
| Stored | Stored | Nothing to do. Should work as before |
