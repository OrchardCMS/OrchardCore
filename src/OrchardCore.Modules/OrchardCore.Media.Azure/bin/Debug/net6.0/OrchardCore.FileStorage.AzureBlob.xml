             <summary>
             Provides an <see cref="T:OrchardCore.FileStorage.IFileStore"/> implementation that targets an underlying Azure Blob Storage account.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             Azure Blob Storage has very different semantics for directories compared to a local file system, and
             some special consideration is required for make this provider conform to the semantics of the
             <see cref="T:OrchardCore.FileStorage.IFileStore"/> interface and behave in an expected way.
            
             Directories have no physical manifestation in blob storage; we can obtain a reference to them, but
             that reference can be created regardless of whether the directory exists, and it can only be used
             as a scoping container to operate on blobs within that directory namespace.
            
             As a consequence, this provider generally behaves as if any given directory always exists. To
             simulate "creating" a directory (which cannot technically be done in blob storage) this provider creates
             a marker file inside the directory, which makes the directory "exist" and appear when listing contents
             subsequently. This marker file is ignored (excluded) when listing directory contents.
            
             Note that the Blob Container is not created automatically, and existence of the Container is not verified.
            
             Create the Blob Container before enabling a Blob File Store.
            
             Azure Blog Storage will create the BasePath inside the container during the upload of the first file.

            <summary>
            Blob prefix requires a trailing slash except when loading the root of the container.
