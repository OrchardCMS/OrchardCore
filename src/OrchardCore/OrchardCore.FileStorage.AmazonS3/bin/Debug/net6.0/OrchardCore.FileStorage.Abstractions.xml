             <summary>
             Represents a generic abstraction over a virtual file store.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             The virtual file store uses forward slash (/) as the path delimiter, and has no concept of
             volumes or drives. All paths are specified and returned as relative to the root of the virtual
             file store. Absolute paths using a leading slash or leading period, and parent traversal
             using "../", are not supported.
            
             This abstraction does not dictate any case sensitivity semantics. Case sensitivity is left to
             the underlying storage system of concrete implementations. For example, the Windows file system
             is case insensitive, while Linux file system and Azure Blob Storage are case sensitive.
