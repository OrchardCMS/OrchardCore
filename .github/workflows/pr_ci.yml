      # Security issues being discovered in NuGet packages we use can happen at any time, and thus all our CI builds that
      # treat warnings as errors could break anytime, without us changing the code. This prevents that. Treating them as
      # warnings and other better approaches don't work, see https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/16317.
